6129,[Question] Possible integration scenario using Event Hub streaming,"Hello all

I was able to find a couple of topics around Orleans Streaming + Event Hub but I haven't been able to find something around the scenario that I've just tried.

I'd like to integrate a couple of applications and I'd like to take advantage of the rewindable streaming support from Orleans+Event Hub. Direct connection between those products is not doable but the following setup seems to work fine. 

If each application bootstraps their own localhost silo and configure the same Event Hub stream provider they will be able to pass events between each other maintain their own cursor or if I start a new silo and create a new subscriber it will just ingest everything until it catches up. Fortunately this is exactly what I need.

Am I missing something? Is this a valid approach? What are the possible issues I can get into (from the Orleans standpoint/Event Hub standpoint)?

6077,Clustering audit log,"Hi

I would like to open a discussion:

For me the clustering is sometimes hard to understand and it would be very good to have some kind of an audit log like in kubernetes with high level messages that tell me the status of the cluster such as:

* Member <Hostname> (IP) has joined the cluster.
* Member <Hostname> (IP) is not reachable from <Hostname> (IP) <HostName> (IP) and ...

This could be very valuable because reading the logs can be hard and in case of cluster errors you can have thousand of consecutive errors that you need to filter out.

Just this morning my k8 has restarted my nodes because the health check became unhealthy and do not really understand the reason.

It would be great to have a IAuditLog interface that just logs it to the logger but can also be used to persist it to a database and then consumed by OrleansDashboard or so.

In case you are writing a product for others users like Squidex (https://github.com/squidex/squidex) it is hard to get good default values for the logs. Either it is too much or too less.

Or we need to be more careful with logging categories because class names are not a good source for categories especially when potentially dozens of classes are involved to do a job like clustering.

To be honest I have no idea what something like this means:

Let's say we have a set of player grains.  
Also assume that for saving data for each user in playfab you need the user's ID which the grain has at runtime and it cannot be deduced from grain key how can we send this info to our storage provider when we initialize the grain/when calling WriteStateAsync so the provider can do its job? 

One easy/dirty way of solving it is to have an object argument for WriteStateAsync and ReadStateAsync but probably it can be done better.

In short the intent is to remove the feature due to maintainability and design-related concerns in the face of the pub-sub system becoming a public surface.
My understanding is that the primary design concern stems from the way the filter predicate is specified.  In the current implementation the identity of the filter predicate (represented by a class name and method name tuple) is supplied by the subscribing party. In addition to constraining  eligible predicates to  static methods the mechanism used to extract this identity employs delegates and leads to an undesirable dependency whereby the predicate function must be available to both producer and consumer. While this may appear fairly benign in the case in which both the producer and the consumer are grains this requirement becomes harder to justify when consuming streams from an Orleans client. 

**Advocating for retaining producer-side filtering** 

> Please note that the scenarios described below have been significantly simplified for the sake of brevity

We use per-grain streams to publish incremental grain state changes in a variation on event sourcing. Clients subscribe to these streams to render changes to grain state in real time. Upon subscribing a new client receives an optimized version of the change log allowing it to ""catch-up"" with the current grain state - we are currently using the feature in production to selectively deliver this class of messages to only the newly subscribed client. 

In addition to simple state(s) grains can hold collections - changes to these collections are similarly propagated to clients in real time. Clients can construct queries over these collections the results of which are also updated in real time - we are currently using the feature in production to selectively deliver initial query results to only the client that has made the query. 

Continuing to be able to filter such messages on the producer side is very important to us.

**Possible approaches to retaining producer-side filtering**
 
It appears that allowing arbitrary client-supplied predicates while addressing the coupling concern would require serializing the predicate closure provided by the consumer at subscription time and then deserializing and executing it on the producer side.
While serializers that could be used to implement such behavior exists (e.g. [FsPickler](https://github.com/mbraceproject/FsPickler) [Hyperion](https://github.com/akkadotnet/Hyperion)) It is unclear to me at this point whether the added complexity is warranted and how such complexity would impact the goal of having an easily-maintainable public pub-sub surface.

A more conservative approach would avoid passing predicate identity during subscription altogether and instead rely on the predicate being supplied on the producer side at the time of event emission. A subscriber would continue to be able to attach custom data to the subscription data that could be used on the producer side to affect predicate logic. 
It is of note that this approach while not requiring the subscriber to supply the predicate identity would continue to allow the subscriber to choose a specific predicate logic out of a well-known set of choices available producer-side by means of adequately constructed custom subscription data.

I am proposing adopting the latter approach based on its relative simplicity and on the fact that it allows for a straightforward migration path - please let me know if this would be acceptable in principle. If so I will try to modify the current implementation and tests accordingly and submit a PR

Please also let me know if you would like to discuss any of the above offline I am more than happy to do so.

5883,Improve codegen's .NET Core 3 compatibility 2,"fixes #5880 

The fix allows the codegen for dotnet to use a runtime >= 3.0.0 as fallback if the 2.0 runtime cannot be found. This allow code generation in only dotnet 3.0 environments.

The changes are the same as for #5799 for the MSBuild codegenerator.

I also included the codegenerator in Bootstrap so that building Orleans itself is now possible only with a dotnet 3.0 runtime.

It maybe a good idea to do that for the MSBuild codegen in Bootstrap too. Should I include the change in this pull request?

With the introduction of new networking APIs (Bedrock) we will support custom transports. Some of these transports may not use IPEndpoint (the type of SiloAddress.Endpoint). For example a transport may use Named Pipes or some other IPC mechanism or HTTPS or something built from a connection string.

Bedrock transports accept an endpoint using the abstract System.Net.Endpoint type. The idea behind this was that users could create any kind of transport and implement a custom Endpoint implementation for their application.

In order to ensure we can leverage an ecosystem of transports and connection middleware we should consider a customisation point for users to provide a translation between SiloAddress and the particular Endpoint type used by their transport.

I think it could be as simple as this:

5797,How to structure Grains for fast loading of historical data?,"Hello and thanks for building such an incredible framework. I’m beginning the process of sorting out how to leverage Orleans in a major revision of a project that I work on and have several high level questions that I’m hoping to receive some guidance on so I can avoid starting down the wrong path. If there is a better place or way to ask these questions I’d be happy to change venues. Also since I feel that an example application to tie together some of these concepts would help me personally as well as other newcomers in the IoT space I am very interested in contributing an example/quick start once I have a solid path to head down.

The platform that I’m working on handles the dispatching of work to drivers with the complexity that it is a multi-tenant application so we need to ensure each organization’s data is exclusive to their users and tablets. We currently provide this by putting each tenant’s data in their own SQL DB that only their users have access to (every tenant has a connection string to the correct DB). The dispatchers are using a windows desktop back office application with a companion ReactJS web app for viewing realtime/historical locations and the drivers are using an Android tablet app. We currently tie this all together with a blend of RESTish (there’s some RPC endpoints in it too) WebAPI that makes heavy use of Azure Event Hubs for incoming data from the tablets (processing happens in windows services that are subscribed to the hubs something that we want to move to Orleans) uses SignalR for pushing realtime data to the browser and loads most things out of each tenant’s SQL DB (which are not all in the same datacenter as the API).

So now that the “what” of what I’m trying to improve is out of the way where I need help is how we’re going to best utilize Orleans to improve our API. Using Orleans for the basic activity of the application feels really straight forward (although perhaps I’m over simplifying it) in that we can easily assign a Job to a Driver and trigger a push notification to the Device that the driver is using. When data comes in from a Device we can use an Event Hub based stream to queue the processing of its data and push the new location to the web app in realtime with SignalR. The challenging part for me is how to structure all this so that historical data can be easily and quickly retrieved as well as avoid packing too much data into a single Grain.

An example of this is that dispatchers may want to see the path a driver traveled to get to a job. Currently we load that data from the tenant’s DB and I would assume that is still the best way to handle it since loading data for a single driver is relatively quick. Where performance becomes challenging is loading the location of all devices from a particular point in time. Would it be reasonable to have a  that returns a list of all devices with their last known location at that point in time? If so what is the recommendation for implementing something like that? Would it work to asyncly iterate through all the devices asking each of them to figure out where they where (there can be 100 - 1000ish devices per tenant)? We currently make this perform reasonably well by constantly building per-minute time windowed data for each tenant that is persisted separately so we can grab the time window that holds the locations we’re looking for. This is expensive from a storage standpoint so we trash the time windows after 7 days and queries for older data become slow. This feels like an area of our application that we should be able to improve with the power of Orleans but I’m struggling to come up with an architecture that feels like a winner (likely because my optics are based in the way we’ve already solved it). If the pre-calculated time windows are still the best bet is there an example out there of how to do this in Orleans (essentially a per-minute list of all the location changes for all devices belonging to a tenant). 

This question is getting too long so I’ll leave it rooted in the historical data persistence and retrieval for now and as I gain a better understanding of the Orleans way of accomplishing some of this I’ll drill into other challenging aspects of the application.

If there’s some documentation that I should be reading to help come up with a solution or an example that I should be referencing instead of asking for help please share and I’ll gladly keep trying to sort this out on my own.

5765,Add locking support similar to Azure durable functions 2.0,"Add locking support similar to one described here https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/durable/durable-functions-preview#locking-entities-from-orchestrations that I copy & pasted below

This would be really helpful for avoiding raced conditions and should scale better that going through single grain to achieve the same.

> Locking entities from orchestrations
Orchestrations can lock entities. This capability provides a simple way to prevent unwanted races by using critical sections.
>
> The context object provides the following methods:
>
> LockAsync: acquires locks on one or more entities.
IsLocked: returns true if currently in a critical section false otherwise.
The critical section ends and all locks are released when the orchestration ends. In .NET LockAsync returns an IDisposable that ends the critical section when disposed which can be used together with a using clause to get a syntactic representation of the critical section.
>
> For example consider an orchestration that needs to test whether two players are available and then assign them both to a game. This task can be implemented using a critical section as follows:


> Within the critical section both player entities are locked which means they are not executing any operations other than the ones that are called from within the critical section). This behavior prevents races with conflicting operations such as players being assigned to a different game or signing off.
>
> We impose several restrictions on how critical sections can be used. These restrictions serve to prevent deadlocks and reentrancy.
>
> Critical sections cannot be nested.
> Critical sections cannot create suborchestrations.
> Critical sections can call only entities they have locked.
> Critical sections cannot call the same entity using multiple parallel calls.
> Critical sections can signal only entities they have not locked.

3 silos running on separate EC2 instances in docker
3 frontend servers

Load test client generating a minor load (~100 grains per silo ~1-2 messages per second)

Grain is activated on Silo1
Silo1 is shut down

Log message timestamps (filtered by the id of this player's grain):

17:15:48.770 silo-2 message indicating the grain has been activated (error message that indicates that the state is not what we expect it to be meaning this state is out of date)
17:15:49.575 silo-1 message indicating grain is being shut down
17:15:49.585 silo-1 message indicating state is written to the database
17:15:52.831 silo-1 message indicating the graceful shutdown of the silohost has completed

The occurence rate is about 1-2% of grains under mild load. This is obviously a massive issue because the state gets corrupted as the flush in silo-1 doesn't complete before silo-2 claims ownership of the data.

Is there any potential setup error that can cause this?

5676,Journaling grain and event sourcing,"Hello

First of all I want to give my appreciation to the team and contributors to Orleans it's a great solution for distributed computing. I've been working with it for awhile now and I'm very pleased with both functionality and how nicely it fits with modern architecture and design.

This issue is more about the documentation and somewhat about events with journaled grains in the context of event sourcing. Let me give my observations.

At the heart of event sourcing is the statement that an event signals that a state has changed meaning that any subscriber to the event can rest assure that the state is consistent with the event. The journaled grain however uses the event as to signal that the state should change e.g. with this event persist update to storage.

This is a typical call chain with Orleans.EventSourcing.CustomStorage (never mind the ReadStateFromStorage that might or not happen before the chain described):

1. RaiseEvent tells the provider that an event is to be fired
2. ApplyUpdatesToStorage is called to persist the event to storage
3. Apply (or TransitionState) is called to update aggregate state

As I understand it and see from other event sourcing solutions the chain maybe should be this:

1. ApplyUpdatesToStorage (to change the domain state meaning persist event(s))
2. RaiseEvent tells the provider that domain state has changed
3. Apply (or TransitionState) is called to update aggregate state

It's kind of backwards in the implementation of Orleans with the semantics of events in the context of event sourcing. This initially caused me confusion and I had to try to figure out what was going on before I finally realized the mechanics. I don't propose to do anything rather maybe in the documentation try to highlight if needed the difference.

Kind regards
//Jan

5631,Catalog and Directory Grains failing to communicate - Select Activation Timeouts,"Hi

We are having issues in our cluster with select activation timeouts between the catalog and directory grains - Issue below.



Once this error starts it never recovers and that source silo seems to stop doing much useful work.  We have struggled to nail down when it happens.

Is it possible to move those system grains away from silos that run our grains so we can rule out our interaction with the silo which I am sure it is what we are doing on there

Can you effectively segment the cluster to allow system grains on one half and custom grains on the other ?

Thanks","Catalog and Directory Grains failing to communicate - Select Activation Timeouts Hi

5630,[Question] Deadlock in streams handling,"Hello 

I am trying to implement some kind of RPC using Orleans 2.0 streams.

In grain method grain awaits publishing to CommandStream and then observes response from CommandResponseStream awaiting the result 

remote service (another process) observes incoming command from CommandStream and then handles the command and awaits publishing result back to CommandResponseStream.

Looks like this setup gets deadlocked somehow in the internals of Orleans after remote service handles the command and publishes the response. I assume due to custom scheduler used. As if I mark the grain as  everything works as expected looks like [Reentrancy within a call chain](https://dotnet.github.io/orleans/Documentation/grains/reentrancy.html#reentrancy-within-a-call-chain) does not work in this case. Maybe it would if instead of two streams I had used GrainObserver + CommandResponseStream.

So for now the only workaround I see is to use predicate to control reentrancy as in general I do not want my code to be reentrant but is that the right way of implementing such calls? 

Thanks in advance.","[Question] Deadlock in streams handling Hello

5629,[Question] EventHub stream not all consumers receiving events instantly,"We have a stream per order with some (10+) consumers all marked with ImplicitStreamSubscription attribute. Sometimes we see in logs that after event were sent to stream only few consumers receive it instantly. Others are hung until next event comes.
Something like this:

13:07:02.251 event 'First' sent to stream
13:07:02.258 event 'First' received by Grain**A**
...
13:32:23.054 event 'Second' sent to stream
13:32:23.200 event 'First' received by Grain**B**
13:32:23.200 event 'Second' received by Grain**A**
13:32:23.283 event 'Second' received by Grain**B**

So **25 minutes** passed since GrainA received event from stream without any impact on GrainB. And only when new event (Second) was sent - GrainB was triggered and received both these events.
How could that happen? That's not a throttling because event's message already read from stream provider parsed but delivered only to one of consumers.
The confusing part here is that 'Second' event is delivered to GrainA **same millisecond** as 'First' delivered to GrainB. Like if GranB were to trigger for 'Second' event but found 'First' in queue ahead forgotten for some reason and triggered now by FIFO principle.
Logs shows that grains are instatiated on different silos. GrainA lives on same silo where producer ran.

5625,Performance issues using Streams as backchannels to Frontend Servers,"We are currently load testing our Orleans cluster and are experiencing some performance issues with streams. The general architecture is split into three major components: Mobile Clients Frontend Servers and Silohosts.

Mobile clients connect to Frontend Servers with a TCP socket. Each client has one PlayerGrain in the Silohost containing the state of the player. Each player may belong to up to one Guild which are represented by a GuildGrain. Once a Mobile Client opens a TCP connection to Frontend a PlayerConnection object is created in the FrontEnd which then calls SubscribeAsync on a stream (SimpleMessageStreamProvider) in the Player namespace and a stream in the Guild namespace. These streams are then used by PlayerGrains and GuildGrains to push data to the mobile clients. Once the PlayerConnection object is disposed we call Unsubscribe with the stream handles.

In the load test we are creating mock mobile clients that register a new player join a guild and start sending chat messages every ~5 seconds. When the guild grain receives the message it pushes it down to the guild stream and all subscribed PlayerConnections push it down to the mobile clients via the TCP socket. 

The weird behaviour is exhibited when we change the number of players per guild between 30 and 10 players. The performance of the Silohost drops drastically (approximately a 50% drop in concurrently online player capability) if we increase the players per guild to 30. The only effect this has is that now each chat message is sent 3x as many subscribers on the FrontEnd all other variables should be the same. The FrontEndServer's performance doesn't seem to suffer much. 

Is this possibly caused by the fact that the FrontEndServer has 10 (or 30) separate subscriptions to the same Guild stream and if so how can it be shared without building some kind of a Hub that holds the subscriptions? Also what is worrying is if sharing the subscriptions is the answer then at a very large scale when players in a guild are load balanced to different FrontEndServers the I assume the problem will reappear.

One other performance-related issue we've seen with streams is in scenarios where a large number of PlayerGrains are deactivated (around 600 or so) we can see very large latencies (~300ms) for the UnregisterProducer method in the Dashboard causing massive CPU spikes in the Silohost.

Do any of these symptoms sound like we have somehow incorrectly implemented streams and/or is there any specific diagnostic data we could provide to help investigate?","Performance issues using Streams as backchannels to Frontend Servers We are currently load testing our Orleans cluster and are experiencing some performance issues with streams.

The performance of the Silohost drops drastically (approximately a 50% drop in concurrently online player capability) if we increase the players per guild to 30. The only effect this has is that now each chat message is sent 3x as many subscribers on the FrontEnd all other variables should be the same. The FrontEndServer's performance doesn't seem to suffer much. 

Is this possibly caused by the fact that the FrontEndServer has 10 (or 30) separate subscriptions to the same Guild stream and if so how can it be shared without building some kind of a Hub that holds the subscriptions? Also what is worrying is if sharing the subscriptions is the answer then at a very large scale when players in a guild are load balanced to different FrontEndServers the I assume the problem will reappear.

One other performance-related issue we've seen with streams is in scenarios where a large number of PlayerGrains are deactivated (around 600 or so) we can see very large latencies (~300ms) for the UnregisterProducer method in the Dashboard causing massive CPU spikes in the Silohost.

Do any of these symptoms sound like we have somehow incorrectly implemented streams and/or is there any specific diagnostic data we could provide to help investigate?",,sergeybykov,,

My perspective coming into this is that I'm looking to implement a mostly pure-AMQP stream provider (RabbitMQ) and add it to the project. It's entirely possible that I missed the intent of some of the existing interfaces they aren't documented well and the formal documentation isn't much more helpful.

Right now with how many design decisions the stream interfaces forces me to make I've been considering just adding a stream consumer middleware in my system and then each message received will just call a grain.

### Design Decisions

From the outside looking in the idea of having an internal stream provider which arbitrates on behalf of stream providers is a great idea and I think that was definitely a great decision. However I think the current implementation forces too many decisions on a given external provider and it forces extension devs to implement things strictly which isn't that great.

5527,Add RabbitMQ as a Stream Provider,"This is my first significant PR and I think I got some stuff wrong but I wanted to submit it as a draft and work through the feedback while it's still a WIP.

## RabbitMQ Stream Provider

This implements all of the Stream Provider interfaces for formal RabbitMQ support. My team and I (@zednis et al) have a use case for RabbitMQ and since I were going to implement it for our use cases it seemed better to donate the effort for others.

### TODO

I need to address these items before it's ready for a more formal review. Also please let me know if there's anything major I'm missing that's not covered under the list below.

- [ ] Write tests

I used the GCP PubSub provider as the reference item and I saw the tests in the original PR but they've moved locations and I cannot find them. I will also need a way to require RabbitMQ to be available so the test suite can be run. I would love some advice in this area because I'd like for folks to be able to do local testing. RabbitMQ server is licensed with the Mozilla Public License 1.1 so there should be no distribution concerns when working with the RabbitMQ server binaries.

- [ ] Pull design pattern

The C# RabbitMQ client is designed to be very simple with a totally hidden implementation. As part of that it when I was working through the implementation it felt really clunky and didn't seem to mesh well with the current provider interface designs for Stream Providers. I would love to hear some feedback on the design pattern that I used to make sure it feels _right_ because it feels a bit wrong to me. Some of this is likely because of the RabbitMQ client implementation but I'd love some more constructive feedback on the topic.

- [ ] Pushing API?

Are there any plans for a more asynchronous queue layer? RabbitMQ is a provider that would benefit from that as there is first class support for pushing messages to the client.

- [ ] AMQP Interfaces?

Are there any plans for an interface that's a bit closer to the core AMQP design patterns? It would've been super useful to be able to have backend primitives/interfaces that were much more closely aligned with Exchanges Queues Dead Lettering etc.

- [ ] Nuget Package

I need to make a Nuget package out of this but I'm not sure how that works.

- [ ] Error Codes?

The GCP provider has error codes. I didn't implement any specific error codes is that something I need to do? If so is there guidance on how to go about that?

- [ ] Namespace

I didn't know what to put for the namespace so I put  at the time. I'm happy to fix the namespacing to whatever the group things.

Edit: namespace comments.

Signed-off-by: Mike Lloyd <mike@reboot3times.org>","Add RabbitMQ as a Stream Provider This is my first significant PR and I think I got some stuff wrong but I wanted to submit it as a draft and work through the feedback while it's still a WIP.

## RabbitMQ Stream Provider

This implements all of the Stream Provider interfaces for formal RabbitMQ support. My team and I (@zednis et al) have a use case for RabbitMQ and since I were going to implement it for our use cases it seemed better to donate the effort for others.

### TODO

I need to address these items before it's ready for a more formal review. Also please let me know if there's anything major I'm missing that's not covered under the list below.

- [ ] Write tests

I used the GCP PubSub provider as the reference item and I saw the tests in the original PR but they've moved locations and I cannot find them. I will also need a way to require RabbitMQ to be available so the test suite can be run. I would love some advice in this area because I'd like for folks to be able to do local testing. RabbitMQ server is licensed with the Mozilla Public License 1.1 so there should be no distribution concerns when working with the RabbitMQ server binaries.

- [ ] Pull design pattern

The C# RabbitMQ client is designed to be very simple with a totally hidden implementation. As part of that it when I was working through the implementation it felt really clunky and didn't seem to mesh well with the current provider interface designs for Stream Providers. I would love to hear some feedback on the design pattern that I used to make sure it feels _right_ because it feels a bit wrong to me. Some of this is likely because of the RabbitMQ client implementation but I'd love some more constructive feedback on the topic.

- [ ] Pushing API?

Are there any plans for a more asynchronous queue layer? RabbitMQ is a provider that would benefit from that as there is first class support for pushing messages to the client.

- [ ] AMQP Interfaces?

Are there any plans for an interface that's a bit closer to the core AMQP design patterns? It would've been super useful to be able to have backend primitives/interfaces that were much more closely aligned with Exchanges Queues Dead Lettering etc.

- [ ] Nuget Package

I need to make a Nuget package out of this but I'm not sure how that works.

- [ ] Error Codes?

The GCP provider has error codes. I didn't implement any specific error codes is that something I need to do? If so is there guidance on how to go about that?

- [ ] Namespace

I didn't know what to put for the namespace so I put  at the time. I'm happy to fix the namespacing to whatever the group things.

5513,Design pattern for starting and not blocking on long running task but notified of completion,"Hello

I have a use case where a Grain may want to kick off a long running operation and I want to be notified of its completion but don’t want to block (even via await’ing a thread pool task) the long running operation so the Grain can continue to respond to other messages.

I’m thinking I need to have this Grain maybe queue a message in a regular job/service bus queue with the Id of the Grain who asked for the long running task to be performed have a non-Orleans worker process do that task.

When the task is complete send a message back to the Grain.

5510,Stream messages not reaching all client-based subscribers,"I have a problem whereby some stream subscribers are not receiving messages published to that stream.

Our system is set up with Web API REST endpoints which use an Orleans IClusterClient to access boundary grains.  These grains hand off the process to internal grains some of which are stateless workers and eventually this will result in a message being published to a Simple Message Provider stream.  When invoked the Web API controllers subscribe to this stream via a singleton IClusterClient and the handler for this subscription returns the result back to the caller.  We pass a correlation Id (Guid) into the Orleans.RequestContext and check this in the stream handler to confirm we're processing the correct message.  All streams use the same Guid (Guid.Empty) as their Id but the namespace of the stream will change based on the request being made.  When the controller is disposed it unsubscribes from the stream.

The problem occurs when multiple concurrent requests are sent to our Web API.  What we see is when the system is started up from cold the first set of concurrent requests all succeed.  Messages are published received by the controllers and responses are returned to the callers.  However from that point on each subsequent set of concurrent requests see some of the requests timeout because the messages being published are not being handled by the controllers.  The number of requests that fail is variable.  Sometimes only one is successful sometimes only one fails and every point in between but there is always at least one success and one failure in each batch.

I have (I think) verified that the messages are being published correctly by subscribing to the same stream within a grain that is invoked as part of the call chain.  Our logs show that the messages are always being handled by this grain.

After a period of rest (sorry I haven't ascertained exactly how long this is) the system seems to go back to its initial state and a batch of requests work correctly but from there on in it's as it was before.

For the time being we have got around this problem by using a distinct Guid (the correlation Id) for each request but this is not ideal.

I'm mostly confused as to why it all works the first time and only subsequent sets of requests fail.

Is there anything else we can investigate to see what may be the root cause of this?

We're using v2.1.2 of Orleans.

Many thanks

5432,Concerns regarding lack of separation between indexing and storage,"During our work on the CosmosDB provider we've found some concerns regarding the implementation of indexing and the lack of separation from the storage provider. 

The tl;dr should probably be something in the lines of ""storage and indexing is different and in most cases will require different implementations backing them"" there fore it should not be implemented by the same interface. 

A bit longer version:

1. Indexing is implicit in the write state async call the storage provider must be aware of how to enable indexing of selected paths or able to extract these from the state. 

According to code comments CosmosDB is currently the only provider supporting this and some providers such as Blob or table storage will have a hard time supporting it without companion service. 

Services not able to apply indexing directly on the state (Se also 3. on CosmosDB) will have to extract the indexed fields from state them self and store them properly. This seems to require a bit of duplicated and possible complex code in each provider which could be avoided using the defined methods DirectApplyIndexUpdate and DirectApplyIndexUpdateBatch defined in IIndexInterface and then call to an interface implemented by a (storage- or) Index-Provider. 

The index read query does not read state data it only returns GrainReference thus the index besides searching has no use of the state it self. 

2. Reading from index is done via dynamic without a defined interface although commented with ""TODO: define IOrleansIndexingStorageProvider?""

If one are to implement an IndexingStorageProvider it would make even more sense to implement write this way as well.

3. The current implementation in CosmosDB effectively limits a grain type to at most 10GB of data as GrainType is used as partition key. 

The current CosmosDB implementatione queries using stored procedures which cannot be used in cross partition queries. As partitioning and querying is done by GrainType this limits the amount of data for a single grain type to 10GB. 

A pull request to allow [custom partitioning based on GrainReference](https://github.com/OrleansContrib/Orleans.CosmosDB/pull/26) solves this propblem for general state storage but does not address indexing. Indexing can still work with this pull request if the CosmosDB provided is change from a stored procedure query to a SQL query    with feed options set to allow cross partition queries. This will come at a potentially significant cost in terms of request charge on the CosmosDB and it may be that it will be better to store index data for CosmosDB separately with only the indexed data and grain reference partitioned by the grain type while letting the state it self follow custom partition key logic.

5427,Question: implement custom read-only stream provider,"Hi

We have a global event-log in our system (implemented using [SQLStreamStore](https://github.com/SQLStreamStore/SQLStreamStore)).

The system is based on JournalledGrains which write (produce) events to the log. 

After an event is sucessfully written it is published onto an orleans stream with a fixed namespace and a fixed id so essentially there is one large stream.

Eventprocessors are implemented using Implicit Subscriptions on the global stream.

Currently we're using the Azure storage queue streamprovider which is not optimal for our use-case. We're facing several problems:

1 a slow eventprocessor impact all event processing (because we use a single streamid/streamnamespace)
2 we can not rewind (start at a specific position) per eventprocessor
3 latency of eventprocessing is suboptimal because of dispatching the event to azure storage

We've discussed this internally and come up with 2 possible solutions:

**Drop orleans streams and subscribe directly to global event-log**

In this solution our eventprocessors each have an own cursor to the event-log this let's them work at their own pace without impacting other eventprocessors. They each poll the event-log for new messages after their last-processed event.

Challenges in this solution are
* Database overload.  
Because each eventprocessor is polling the database in short intervals this could overload the db. Solution would could to cache this per silo where each eventprocessor subscribes to the cache where it is activated challenges with this caching strategy are how to handle slow consumers
* Always-on eventprocessors
Eventprocessors have to be kept alive this could be implemented by some sort of watchdog-grain which invokes the eventprocessors at timed intervals to keep them alive. (we previously relied on implicit subscriptions for this).

**Hybrid solution implementing custom readonly-streamprovider**

Because our event-log is basically a stream we could implement our own (readonly) streamprovider for it. I've looked at the azure storage queue and the AWS implementations. Implementing something like that is fairly straightforward. But I have a few questions:
* how to make them rewindable
* how to implement this so each streamconsumer (on one single stream) does not impact each other.
* can orleans streaming be adapted so it is feasible to use with 1 stream and many subscribers

5421,Co-hosting Orleans and ASP.NET in the same process - performance recommendations,"As requested on Gitter this is an open-ended thread to discuss what are the general performance benefits and drawbacks regarding co-hosting an ASP.NET Front-end (e.g. a RESTful API over Kestrel on ASP.NET Core) in the same process (and by consequence physical host) of an Orleans silo. This question takes special aim at Orleans' use of its own cooperative scheduler vs ASP.NET's use of the Thread Pool and how they would compete for host resources.

Specifically what are the engineering team's thoughts regarding:
- CPU expenditure on thread context switching.
- CPU cache use and possible trashing.
- Scalability benefits and drawbacks.
- Performance benefits and drawbacks.
- Memory contention and possible virtual memory trashing.
- Benefit/drawback relationship as cluster size increases.

The idea is to have some good practice pointers for Orleans users like me to decide when/if it is a good idea to host ASP.NET and Orleans together in the same process (and thereby physical host) or to keep them separate in a client-silo relationship across separate processes (and also machines via the wire) and in what conditions.

If there is already some official documentation regarding this then apologies for raising the issue and ""preemptive"" thanks for redirecting me to it. If not then happy to gather relevant input and PR the docs.","Co-hosting Orleans and ASP.NET in the same process - performance recommendations As requested on Gitter this is an open-ended thread to discuss what are the general performance benefits and drawbacks regarding co-hosting an ASP.NET Front-end (e.g. a RESTful API over Kestrel on ASP.NET Core) in the same process (and by consequence physical host) of an Orleans silo.

5419,Orleans Streaming - sparse streams scenario,"Hi! In our company we are trying to use Orleans for IoT scenario. We using IoT Hub/EventHub.
I did a significant amount of research around how to do this properly using available possibilities in Orleans. It turned out that we cannot use Streaming with modified EventHub provider as current implementation has problems with huge number of sparse streams (if we would like to use Stream per Device). Each device can send relatively small amount of data in not so short period like one minute for example. But we can have them really huge number like half millions. That in average can give us around 8k messages per second to the system but for each device - one message per minute. 
Currently using Orleans that way (Stream per Device) turns out really quickly to be inefficient (around 10-20k streams). For that reason we choose hosting EPH along with the silo (as GrainService) and just pass messages directly to the ""device"" grain. That easily could handle 500k grains (if machine RAM was enough). 
I did some time ago discussion about that with @jason-bragg and eventually possibilities of implementing/improving current Streams to handle sparse streams. 
Now i have a time to do more investigation on that and would like to play with it a bit. I wonder if we could have discussion here how this could be handled inside Orleans runtime - some guidance from you guys so i could know where to start looking at.

My first approach was to send each message to unique stream in the same namespace. So if message has id = GUID then it is sent to stream <GUID ""Namespace"">. On the processing side I used implicit subscription grain ProcessingGrain with attr [ImplicitStreamSubscription(""Namespace"")]. So as many there are messages to process that many streams and grains are created. After message GUID is processed stream <GUID ""Namespace""> and  ProcessingGrain <GUID> is not needed anymore so I configured ProcessingGrain to be Deactivated after 5 minutes. Not active streams are cleared from Orleans after StreamPullingAgentOptions.StreamInactivityPeriod that was left with the default value = 10 min.

and in all scenarios real Azure Queues were stopped being processed after 10-40 minutes of work. So pulling agents just don't pull messages anymore. Logs show that PubSubCacheSize grows all the time and at value 250-400k mentioned fail occurs. 
Old Grains are successfully deactivated and streams too but after fail occurs streams are not cleared. So value of PubSubCacheSize goes up and down but then on value of 250-400k it is not cleared anymore. At the same time all processing grains are eventually deactivated.

After chatting on gitter I understood that I need to try a solution of pool of streams with fixed number of them to avoid this situation of unbounded number of streams. 

- But anyway I think it is an issue that system just stops process streams with even no message in logs. It looks like everything is fine but messages just accumulate in Azure Queue. 
- Also I don't understand why if inactive streams are cleared after StreamInactivityPeriod and all grains are deactivated the described pattern of 1stream\msg is not working one? It seems to me that up to some load the system should feel fine. New messages create new objects in the system but at that time old objects (streams system info and grains) have been cleared already.

Besides of my (actually not recommended in the docs) scenario please consider another one:
The system creates a group of grains per some event e.g. conference. These grains use persistant stream like AzureQueue for some communication. Conferences should not know about each other so each conference=group of grains uses its own stream Id = Conference Id. The frequency of new conferences creation can be high comparable with my test 100-500/sec. Here each stream is used many times but like in my test when the conference ends stream is not needed anymore. It will never be used again. So number of streams in system can slowly grow. So now it looks similar to my test. 
And I'm afraid that on some load Orleans will stop process streams and create new ones because of some reason. May be because it can't handle situation when speed of new streams creation is more than speed of clearing inactive streams?

Thanks!","AzureQueues stops being processed when large and growing number of streams uses it I test Orleans for the use case when large number of independant messages should be processed in the fastest and scalable way. My first approach was to send each message to unique stream in the same namespace. So if message has id = GUID then it is sent to stream <GUID ""Namespace"">. On the processing side I used implicit subscription grain ProcessingGrain with attr [ImplicitStreamSubscription(""Namespace"")]. So as many there are messages to process that many streams and grains are created. After message GUID is processed stream <GUID ""Namespace""> and  ProcessingGrain <GUID> is not needed anymore so I configured ProcessingGrain to be Deactivated after 5 minutes. Not active streams are cleared from Orleans after StreamPullingAgentOptions.StreamInactivityPeriod that was left with the default value = 10 min.
Stream: AzureQueueStreamProvider
Clustering: AzureStorageClustering
Monitoring: Orleans Dashboard 2.2.0

I tried these load scenarios:
- 100-1000 msgs/sec
- 1-2 silos
- 1-8 queues in Azure Queue

5326,SimpleMessageStream performance seems not good enough,"According to the [Orleans Streams Documention](https://dotnet.github.io/orleans/Documentation/streaming/index.html) I try to write a chat demo which uses the SimpleMessageStream. I just want to simulate some simple usecases in a chat system such as one-to-one chat. 

The demo looks like:
1. A silo cluster(more than 2 silo servers )
2. Several clients each one simulates hundreds of users(in fact it's a gateway between the silo server and the user's devices. Because Orleans doesn't want to directly exposed the server address to the user right?)  
3. Each user has a unique ID and subscribes a stream which is based on his ID.So other users can publish a message to a user's stream if they know his ID and the user will receive it because he subscribes himself.

I am concerned about the latency in the chat system so I divide the users into two group(A and B). In group A each user will cyclic(now it is 5 second) send a message with a local unix timestamp to several(now it is 10) users in group B. In group B when a user receive a message from group A it would send the same message(the unix timestamp not change) back to the user in group A. When the user in group A receive the response message he could use the local unix timestamp to calculate the latency.

the client side's code looks like that:
 

The server/client machine's all use CentOS 7 and their cpu(8 cores) usage doesn't reach 100%(in 
 fact the server's usage is only about 40% and the bandwidth is enough. 

Although the average latency seems good but there is 5% latency more than 240 ms and 1%  more than 860 ms. Compare to the NATS's result it is a little bit unacceptable :(

PS:I guess some off-cpu analysis work will be down.

5321,Message / Request Priority,"Hi we are using Orleans as back-end in our IoT project briefly it relies on ConnectionPoint's and Devices. Devices are connected to CP's. Each CP support only one connection in the same time so it's very suitable for CP's to work within single-threaded nature of grains. There are various reminders on CP for each Devices like read device setup read device data heartbeat health-check and some other domain specific operations. CPGrain is not re-entrant and we are using asynchronous socket for communication.

My question is; there is being multiple request by reminders on the CPGrain's mailboxes naturally but we also have some instant request that must be run instantly so expected behavior would be like that even if there are 20 messages in the mailbox cancel current process first (we can handle it with grain cancellation token) and **process instant request before other requests in the mailbox (that is I am asking for) is there a way to do that with Orleans**

Currently we are using priority queue in CPGrain to schedule and prioritize messages/requests but we have to check queue with timer to process. So we are loosing natural flow of Orleans by this custom solution besides lower time interval for that timer would result with high CPU consumption contrary higher time interval would result higher latency. Do you have any suggestion?","Message / Request Priority Hi we are using Orleans as back-end in our IoT project briefly it relies on ConnectionPoint's and Devices. Devices are connected to CP's.

5320,Some questions about placements / discovery / grain types,"Hello there

We are about to run a silo with multiple grain types let's say IA IB IC ... 10 to 15 of them.

They are really distinct domains but we'd like to embed all this little world in the same cluster
- to avoid having to configure multiple IClusterClient and manage them
- and to have aggregated silos statistics all in one on the dashboard.

Those grain are hosted in distinct applications runned in a K8s cluster let's say 3 to 10 replica for each grain type (this way we have the ability to scale each part of the system independendly).

I was a little surprise to see that if I entirely drop a service let's say IZ (it's representing a good 1/3 part of the all system so it's 1/3 silos that are down on the same time) all the clients of the system who are actually never calling Z grains are starting to raise exceptions (mostly TimeOut). Until the cluster is stable again.

My guess is that in fact all silos are responsible for the placement/discovery of any grain of the cluster so the loss of any silo will impact randomly any client in the system depending on the partitions responsiblity ...

Would you say it's an expected behavior ? something that I could avoid somehow ? Is there something I could have greatly missunderstood ?

During the API call I have it instantiating a new client to connect to the cluster and then close at the end when it's finished. However it's causing significant lag where the client could take upwards to 30 seconds to close. Do you guys have a recommended way to manage orleans client or simply make the API call not wait for the client to close() before responding back to the consumer?

5315,Need design advice regarding version selection strategy canary testing grains,"Hi there im working on an IOT project for a production facility and would like to use orleans

One requirement is that I need to be able to roll out updates for only one / some of the devices.

At first I thought I simply create one grain for each device. But im not sure if this will work.

I read the docs but for me it is not clear if / how I can achive what I want. http://dotnet.github.io/orleans/Documentation/deployment/grain_versioning/version_selector_strategy.html

Lets say I have device A and B both running Grain Version 1. And I want to deploy a new version only for Device A.

From what I understand the version is only chosen for new activations. So if an activation exists with V1 it will not be created in V2.

I think I can overcome this with a programmatic deactivation after deploying the update to one of the cluster nodes and then activating the grain again.

The other issue is that I need some custom version selection strategy so the cluster knows that it should create A as V2 and B as V1. 

Is this possible at all?

One thing I found is IPlacementDirector would that be the correct place to implement the desired behavior?

","Samples/2.1/ServiceFabric/Stateless/StatelessCalculatorApp fails to deploy I'm having trouble getting the sample ""Samples/2.1/ServiceFabric/Stateless/StatelessCalculatorApp"" to deploy. I'm using Visual Studio 2017 Community and Windows 10 Pro; OS IDE and Service Fabric tools are all up to date.

I'm able to run a home rolled Service Fabric application/service but just to be sure I reset my cluster and rebooted.

No doubt I'm doing something wrong - any idea what?

5310,Cannot resume stream after silo restart,"In my application I use a SMS provider and I have some issues when the silo restarts
The architecture is basically that:
- The system has a single silo and 2 clients.
- I use a single stream with only 1 grain that publish events
- The 2 clients subscribe directly to the stream.

The problem is when the silo restarts I cannot resume the event subscription
- Sometimes after the restart the stream continues working but this is not frequent
- Calling  doesn't change anything. Is it on purpose? Am I missing something?

I made a simplified repro project that isolate and illustrate the issue: https://github.com/srollinet/OrleansStreamIssue

In the real application I use Ado storage and clustering and I call ResumeAsync only when I detect a connection lost. By the way it seems that the ClusterConnectionLostHandler is not systematically called when the silo crashes.

Bonus question: Is there a better / more robust solution to handle this use case? I have seen some examples with observers but I don't know what is the preferred way in this case.","Cannot resume stream after silo restart In my application I use a SMS provider and I have some issues when the silo restarts

5308,Support customizable Actor type name,"Hi guys
I have multi tenant system and I would like to see all my Actor types in the same cluster for comfort and convenience.
A multi-tenant system means that the same actor type is deployed with different configuration because he will use different persistence queues etc related to his tenant and the health check will be done based on this tenant configuration.
This solution allows me to isolate the traffic/activity by tenant and to scale a tenant independently to the other on the same K8 cluster.

The registration of the actor is based on the silo/actor type.
For example based on this kind of registration I cannot make the distinction because actor type   HelloWorldType deployed on the tenant A and B on same K8 cluster.

In your book you said ""(Orleans is not currently intended for a multi-tenant environment)"": https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Orleans-MSR-TR-2014-41.pdf
But @jkonecki succeed to use Orleans on his multi-tenant system: http://gigi.nullneuron.net/gigilabs/microsoft-orleans-use-case-reservations-system/

On ProtoActor we had the Actor kind concept and it's not related to the Actor Class Name it could be anything which is great!...

Source: https://github.com/AsynkronIT/protoactor-dotnet/blob/74d71f0c9eb14925da59ade42cbec4f2e4a2252f/src/Proto.Remote/Remote.cs

But now that we moved to Orleans we cannot compute the actor type name...

We think that the solution could be to prefix the actor type name with the tenant name for example: 
- Tenant_A_ActorType_HelloWorldType
- Tenant_B_ActorType_HelloWorldType

It could be great if we can customize the actor type name.

We found the VersionAttribute it's not the same but it's something...
But I would prefer to have a more flexible way to indicate the tenant.

What do you think?

I did this testing one single silo cluster.
Machine is around 85% of CPU.
When i launch this grains separately - TelemetryCapture gests 40k /s TelemetryProcessor  around 20k/s. 
Two questions:
- Why performance of TelemetryProcessor is decreased while TelemetryCapture not?
- After a while i see errors on TelemetryProcessor  that ""Item not found in cache"". That suggest that Orleans remove messages from internal cache before grain start to read it. I thought that throttling mechanism is for that and should prevent such situation.

I've ran into this situation many times before. 
I have grains that sometimes I need to update their state but only if they're active.

These grains are heavy to activate since they're doing SQL queries in their  to Get a grain it probably checks against the directory if it's active and if not then it should activate it.. ? so in this process can we expose just the first part? wether it's already active?

Many thanks if you read this far :)","How to invoke a grain only if active? Hi

5203,Handling canary deployments,"This is a new incarnation of an old subject we wrap our head against since starting to use Orleans some years ago :-) 
It's all about deployment strategies. 

A quick description of the problem - we build microservices that use Orleans as their infrastructure. Each microservice is a separate Orleans cluster (with several silos on several machines).
To reduce deployment risks we would like to use canary deployments. Meaning deploy a new version of the service switch a portion of the traffic to it (1% 5%) monitor for differences in behavior if all is well switch to the new version. 

This is a deployment strategy that works well with stateless services. But when using Orleans there are multiple obstacles - 

- You cannot randomly switch traffic. Since you have stateful grains you need to be able to switch a portion of the traffic according to a specific identifier that can signify the grains that are used (so all requests for certain grains ends up in the same cluster - prod or canary). Otherwise you have multiple activation and stale states.

- What do you do if there is no consistent identifier that you can route on for all the methods the service exposes? What if you identify the ""id"" only in the middle of handling the request in the service?

- What if you need to switch off the canary? Some grains were already instantiated in the canary cluster but they might be also active in the prod cluster. Now traffic will go again to prod possibly to the old grains and again you have stale state.

I don't think that the grain versioning feature answers this problem fully. I'm wondering if anyone else tried to handle this or what are the deployment strategies that are actually used in production for high scale systems that are running on Orleans.

5183,More graceful graceful shutdowns,"Orleans version: **2.1.2**

I've been experimenting with rolling upgrades (primarily in Kubernetes) and have noticed some inconsistent behaviour when shutting silos down gracefully (calling ISiloHost.StopAsync()). It is not specific to running in containers though the same behaviour can be observed in console applications.

Note: Generally Orleans does what is advertised on the box but I do feel that graceful shutdowns could be more consistent and ... well more graceful. Even if that means that graceful shutdown would be slower/consist of more phases.

It would be great if errors can be avoided completely when all shutdowns are graceful as is the case with rolling upgrades. This is particularly important when end users interact with grains - long pauses affecting some users during rolling upgrades are not ideal.

To help visualise these I've attached a simple solution consisting of two console apps:
* GracefulShutdownReproSiloHost is the host which should be run a few times to start up a couple of silos.
* GracefulShutdownReproUI requests state and displays placement for 100 grains once per second.

With a few silos running and while watching the UI gracefully shut down a silo by pressing Ctrl+C in its console window.

Some non-ideal behaviours I've observed:
* Spamming the logs with warnings related to shutting down (would it not be better to either avoid these or suppress these as they seem to be just noise?):

* Sometimes a shutdown will result in very quick movement of all grains to different silos bar one or two. The calls to the grains that did not move quickly will not time out but could take 5-10 seconds before they return successfully.
* Sometimes requests to a fair number of grains (those where the silo that was gracefully shut down was the grain directory master) will take about 10 seconds to return with or without warnings logged in the client app and/or by other silos. These are often easier to demonstrate with 2 silos via shutting down one of them as more grains are affected but the behaviour is similar with higher numbers of silos.

PS. When the UI console app runs out of colours just restart it.

[GracefulShutdownRepro.zip](https://github.com/dotnet/orleans/files/2595625/GracefulShutdownRepro.zip)","More graceful graceful shutdowns Orleans version: **2.1.2**

I've been experimenting with rolling upgrades (primarily in Kubernetes) and have noticed some inconsistent behaviour when shutting silos down gracefully (calling ISiloHost.StopAsync()). It is not specific to running in containers though the same behaviour can be observed in console applications.

Note: Generally Orleans does what is advertised on the box but I do feel that graceful shutdowns could be more consistent and ... well more graceful. Even if that means that graceful shutdown would be slower/consist of more phases.

It would be great if errors can be avoided completely when all shutdowns are graceful as is the case with rolling upgrades. This is particularly important when end users interact with grains - long pauses affecting some users during rolling upgrades are not ideal.

In this way messages can be sent periodically (or rarely) on an SMS stream and new subscribers can be brought immediately up to date with the last-sent-message when they subscribe without any extra plumbing code.

For my use case the ""last-sent-message"" would not need to be persisted. It could be just kept in memory but I see the advantage and disadvantages of storing it as well. If the SMS stream is having messages sent rapidly it would ""slow down"" the stream by writing every message to storage before sending it so if storage is to be used there may have to be some configuration regarding the ""max write rate"" to keep the stream running optimally at high messaging rates.

5169,[Question] Writing to storage performance,"Hi everyone! I have following scenario: ClusterClient read events from EventHub and then send them to the Orleans. One grain takes those batches groups them by the key and then send to the second grain which writes to Blob Storage (append blob - one blob for one key). 

I have implementation of this (stateless workers) and everything works fine when key granularity is low. (we make less connection to blobs writing grouped batches). 

But when granularity of key grow (for example in worst scenario we can have one event - one key) bad things start happen and everything chocks up. I understand that this is due to almost one event - one write to blob but i wonder what optimizations can be done here to improve this. 

I tried raising DefaultConnectionLimit play with number of activation of statlessworkers but i can't go beyond of 250 messages per second on single machine (Azure Standard F8s_v2 (8 vcpus 16 GB memory)). This is with default settings. 

To contrast that when i choose one single key to write everything to the same blob in batches (exact same batch which was received in EventHubProccesorHost) i can achieve 25k messages per second on the same machine and have almost half cpu % reserve. Of course the number of writes to the blob storage is far less than 25k messages as single write has up to 1024 messages).
Quotas on blob storage says that it can achieve 20k requests per second. 
Do you have idea how to improve this? How many concurrent connection to the blob one single machine can achieve?

5138,Does Orleans fit my case?,"Hello friends

sorry for posting a question here. I'd like to ask for some suggestions for my scenario and check if Orleans is a good fit for it. 
I have a bunch (about 30000-70000) of processing to perform and would like to split this among 5 high spec computers we have (16 processors 32GB RAM and SSD each).  The processing consists of creating a small input text file and send it to a 3rd party app that process it and return a string as result. This 3rd party app can eat some CPU sometimes it can take 1-3 seconds to process the input.
So the idea would be to create a Job list dispatch this and get the result as its happens. 

Do you thing Orleans is a good pick for this or would you recommend something else?

5133,Add event on gateway count changed,"Based on gitter discussion with @ReubenBond 

Adds an event that the user can listen for changes in the gateway counts. Contains the current count of gateways as well as the previous count (to differentiate between gainin and losing gateways).

It's hard to test the reconnect situation. The only way I found so far to make a test that passes is included but it's not clean. I also had to implement a Reconnect functionality in the ClientMessageCenter for the test but it seems to not actually connect to any silos. The gateways reconnect and send the proper events but any grain requests after Reconnect time out. This makes me wonder if this is only a test cluster scenario (possibly due to faulty Reconnect implementation) or can it also happen in a regular cluster (which would make the entire event useless)

5120,Consume EventHub - the best way to do that,"Hi. Im looking on Orleans and have scenario where i have to read external data from EventHub (EventHub is not populated with data from Orleans applications/clients) and eventually pass them further to other grains - model flows and etc. I wonder - is this is somehow achievable inside orleans middle-tier (to leverage scaling and distributed nature of the system) or i have to externally (as OrleanClient) read the events from EventHub and then eventually pass them to needed grains? 
For example let's assume scenario where i want to read data from EventHub partition them and catch by arbitrary property (UserId) and then write grouped as single transaction (for reach key) to DataLake. The trigger to write should be size of cached data (around 4 MB) or time (if we not make it to gather 4 MB before time elapsed). From theory i would use some Orleans Service or Stream to read data extract key and then pass each message to grain with key as ID - then grain batch this events and have Orleans Timer or size Trigger to flush data do DataLake - but if this has any chance of success? Is 4 MB size grains are suitable for Orleans? And still i have no idea how to read those events from EventHub. 
Is something like this achievable in Olreans?

5093,Testing OneWay grain messages is hard,"Writing tests involving grain calls with [OneWay]s generally means getting to rig up a lock to wait until something else happens to make sure the OneWay actually fired. It's not awful but it does involve lots of boilerplate code.

Has there been any or is there any room for discussing testing these types of grain calls? I can think of a couple of options:
- Horrible static OneWayAttribute test-hook that causes one-way messages to be called normally
- Orleans configuration that causes all one-way attributes to be called normally
- A means of calling a grain method that forces a normal calling (this might exist?)
- The ability to extend OneWayAttribute (it's sealed right now) so as to extend or not from OneWayAttribute based on a configuration flag

Or perhaps there's a more obvious means of doing this in which case that's even better. :)","Testing OneWay grain messages is hard Writing tests involving grain calls with [OneWay]s generally means getting to rig up a lock to wait until something else happens to make sure the OneWay actually fired.

5018,Exception serialization with .NET Core 2.0?,"Hi

I use Orleans since one of one of the earliest alphas for 2.0 with .NET Core and I think that I never had a problem with exceptions although I am not sure.

Recently we discovered a bug where validation details where not displayed correctly in the UI. It does not happen very often because there is also a lot of client side validation. Validation errors are transported with a custom validation exception something like:



Details was always Empty and the reason was that our serialization logic was not correct. So we fixed it: https://github.com/Squidex/squidex/blob/master/src/Squidex.Infrastructure/ValidationException.cs#L53

The docu says:

> Fallback Serialization:  .NET Core uses the ILBasedSerializer by default whereas .NET 4.6 uses BinaryFormatterSerializer by default.

But obviously it cannot be correct for exceptions and I am not sure if this behavior has been changed recently.

Futhermore the documentation says nothing about exceptions and serialization.

Some clarification would be great.","Exception serialization with .NET Core 2.0? Hi

4992,Distributed tracing and Orleans,"# Goal
Distributed tracing that works out-of-the-box with other Microsoft libraries like System.Net (HttpClient) EntityFramework Event Hubs SDK and Service Bus SDK.

# Value
I want to instrument my Orleans application in a way I can correlate events so I can trace the effect of any one request across an entire system across service boundaries. As an example by adding a trace identifier to a HTTP request I want to see that it reaches my gateway (in ASP.NET Core) each grain it hits (in Orleans) the messages it creates (on an Event Hub) and the database transaction it executes (via Entity Framework). 

# Background
I understand Orleans provides an [ActivityId](https://github.com/dotnet/orleans/blob/dad62cc16d4d6de671563f6b1e54196f617926a5/src/Orleans.Core.Abstractions/Runtime/RequestContext.cs#L37) however it doesn't cover distributed tracing out-of-the-box (i.e. flowing that ActivityId to other systems).

I looked at how other Microsoft libraries did this (e.g. [System.Net](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/master/src/System.Net.Http/src/System/Net/Http/DiagnosticsHandler.cs) [Event Hubs SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-event-hubs-dotnet/blob/1a890942ce86339ef4ed97f9246acf36823cb4f7/src/Microsoft.Azure.EventHubs/EventHubsDiagnosticSource.cs)) and they seem to be converging on [System.Diagnostics.Activity](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/master/src/System.Diagnostics.DiagnosticSource/src/System/Diagnostics/Activity.cs) which is available as an AsyncLocal container (Activity.Current) for carrying diagnostic context. (More information about Activity is in [the user guide](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/master/src/System.Diagnostics.DiagnosticSource/src/ActivityUserGuide.md).)
Unfortunately it's not something that is used with Microsoft.Extension.Logging but rather introduces a (yet another) new diagnostic API: [System.Diagnostics.DiagnosticSource](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/master/src/System.Diagnostics.DiagnosticSource/src/System/Diagnostics/DiagnosticSource.cs). DiagnosticSource is distinct from other logging systems in that it's to be consumed in-process and sources normally provide rich payloads.
(More information about DiagnosticSource is in [the user guide](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/master/src/System.Diagnostics.DiagnosticSource/src/DiagnosticSourceUsersGuide.md).)

Libraries using Activity which make or receive external calls often implement some variation of [this correlation protocol](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/master/src/System.Diagnostics.DiagnosticSource/src/HttpCorrelationProtocol.md). This means that the Activity is emitted on outbound requests and resumed on inbound requests.
It [looks](https://github.com/aspnet/Hosting/issues/1457) [like](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/30332) there is work underway to standardize (the header names) based on the [W3C spec for distributed tracing](https://w3c.github.io/distributed-tracing/report-trace-context.html). However Orleans should be able to be instrumented now without being affected by these changes. (Client-to-Orleans calls are via an Orleans-provided library so I don't think a change in header names would be a breaking change.)
~~(There (hopefully?) won't be any change to Activity itself [depending on this discussion](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/30331).)~~
Edit: See @lmolkova's comment for details on the impact of W3C distributed tracing.

# Implementation
There is official guidance for [Activity](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/master/src/System.Diagnostics.DiagnosticSource/src/ActivityUserGuide.md) and [DiagnosticSource](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/master/src/System.Diagnostics.DiagnosticSource/src/DiagnosticSourceUsersGuide.md) but newer documentation is work-in-progress and [available here](https://github.com/Microsoft/ApplicationInsights-dotnet-server/pull/917).

Based on [the experience of people who have consumed DiagnosticSources before](https://github.com/MiniProfiler/dotnet/issues/322#issuecomment-421198415) it looks like a implementation similar to Entity Framework [where the events are typed](https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore/pull/8351) would be preferable.

My insight only goes as deep as poking around over the last week. I've come across people who seem very involved in the .NET and distributed tracing space who might be able to chime in and enlighten us about the right way of approaching this such as @SergeyKanzhelev @lmolkova and @cwe1ss.

## Minimal
A minimal implementation would allow the Activity to flow across service boundaries with a DiagnosticSource for grain requests. Log providers (ILoggerProvider) could optionally listen to this DiagnosticSource (or all DiagnosticSources) and enrich the logs with the Activity context.

* Add an interceptor to start an Activity and add it to the [RequestContext](https://github.com/dotnet/orleans/blob/master/src/Orleans.Core.Abstractions/Runtime/RequestContext.cs).
   @rikbosch has a gist with an implementation of [this part here](https://github.com/dotnet/orleans/issues/3093#issuecomment-308039802).
* Add a client-side interceptor (if that's a thing) which starts an Activity and adds it to the RequestContext.
* Add documentation for log providers wanting to enrich logs with the Activity context and/or document which providers work like this out of the box.
   @SergeyKanzhelev does App Insight's (ASP.NET Core?) ILoggerProvider implementation already make use of the Activity.Current for correlation? I saw [this](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/application-insights/application-insights-correlation) but does that mean it'll work for any DiagnosticSource?
   >Application Insights SDK starting version 2.4.0-beta1 uses DiagnosticSource and Activity to collect telemetry and associate it with the current activity.

## Extended
An extended implementation might go so far as to replace ILogger use in Orleans with DiagnosticSources and provide adapters back to ILogger (and to ITelemetryProvider for performance counters). I think the value of going this far would be to offer richer diagnostics to people who want it (e.g. someone who wants to build a profiler) and a single diagnostics API for Orleans. (The minimal implementation would mean Orleans would offer both ILogger and DiagnosticSource which is ugh.)
","Distributed tracing and Orleans # Goal
Distributed tracing that works out-of-the-box with other Microsoft libraries like System.Net (HttpClient) EntityFramework Event Hubs SDK and Service Bus SDK.

# Value
I want to instrument my Orleans application in a way I can correlate events so I can trace the effect of any one request across an entire system across service boundaries. As an example by adding a trace identifier to a HTTP request I want to see that it reaches my gateway (in ASP.NET Core) each grain it hits (in Orleans) the messages it creates (on an Event Hub) and the database transaction it executes (via Entity Framework).

Is there any option to migrate grain with its state to a new silohost?

3. When new siloHost join cluster - Call DeactivateOnIdle on grains that are on the busiest server 

Maybe to have an easy implementation for archiving the same solution?

1. Fetch statistics - number of siloHosts number of grain (one type) per siloHost
2. Rebalance grains (Need to be atomic)
    a) Take the state of grain
    b) Deactivate grain on SiloHost 1
    b) Activate grain on SiloHost 2 (do not call onActivate event!)

I can suggest two options:
1 - Add **DeclaredStateType** parameter to IGrainStorage methods.
2 - Add DeclaredStateType to IGrainState. This does make the grain state object bigger and I don't know other places using IGrainState. So if there's no benefit other than this I would stay with the hack or give it a second thought.

4834,Questions about Reminders timing,"Hey there
In our team we are using Orleans Reminders to perform an action that should run exactly every 1 hour.
Reminders are registered with the following function: 
As we noticed recently a reminder that was registered with dueTime=0 period=1 hour will not tick every one hour exactly.
It will simply wait 1 hour _after the last reminder ended_ and then send the next reminder tick.
That is a problem to us since the reminder invokes a function that can take few seconds to end. In that case we will have an **accumulative delay** on reminder ticks that will be received every 1 hour **+ epsilon**.

From [Orleans Documentation](https://dotnet.github.io/orleans/1.5/Documentation/Core-Features/Timers-and-Reminders.html) it is said to be the case for Orleans Timers and for Reminders it said that ""Reminders are similar to timers [...]"".

My question is **whether there is an option to configure reminder timing** to be exactly as we registered (first tick after dueTime time and then a tick every period) without being affected by the duration of the function the reminder invokes.
If there isn't other solutions would be (A) making the reminder to invoke a async Task without awaiting for it (B) making the reminder to start a timer to do the actual work or (C) keeping track on the delay from the expected time and once it got too big update and re-schedule the reminder.

We'll be glad to hear if you know a way to handle it or simply what would you do in such cases :)

4832,Serializing Delegates not supported on this platform,"Hi There

I am running the latest version of Orleans on a docker container based upon microsoft/dotnet:2.1-runtime on linux.

It's running at AWS in the ECS environment.

The problem seems to be related to Fallback serialization of exceptions. I make a call to an external library AmazonLambdaClient which is throwing a permissions exception. The permissions exception is a custom exception type and it seems that there is something wrong with serialization of this custom exception within docker on linux. 

For now my workaround is to catch the exception and convert it to a regular System.Exception but I'm guessing this problem will rear it's head somewhere else.

The exception log is below:

4826,Question/Sample Request: Long running function execution via Orleans,"I've seen in the documentation about how ""Orleans is not suited for long running work*"" (*Generally) - I may be paraphrasing. There are a few issues regarding that same topic #4531 #4370 #3071 and several others that I'm having trouble finding ATM.

The tldr of what I'm hoping to accomplish with Orleans is to take lots of calls from my app and dispatch them across a cluster of Orleans silos.  Many of these calls that occur are completed in a few milliseconds but many take several minutes to complete when running in our non-Orleans implementation.  

I understand there is a default timeout of 30 seconds for the client to receive a response from the grain and I would feel weird about increasing that to accommodate our ""longest running logic""  I feel like there has to be a better way of doing it that just increasing the timeout.

Currently my calls (either fast or slow) look similar to this and note this is all CPU bound work:

Client.cs
 in order to keep memory usage down; it seemed like I was getting into some situations where I'd have so many scheduled tasks that all memory would be utilized and nothing would complete.  

The above code does not work without setting the timeout to at least as high as our ""longest running operation"".  It seems that a lot of suggestions on getting around this are to ""return immediately that the task has been started then get the result when it's finished"" but I'm not finding any samples on how to accomplish this at least from both a client and grain perspective.

Could some samples be provided on how to accomplish what I'm going after?  It seems that some sort of check that an invocation is complete would be needed but I'm not sure how to go about that.  Would this require my grains to become stateful rather than stateless? #4370 seems like it ***may*** be of use but I'm only seeing from the grain perspective not what it looks like from the client.  Ideally my fast and long running client/grains with have similar looking implementations but if I have to break out into separate methods for accommodating that's fine as well.

Hopefully this all makes sense!","Question/Sample Request: Long running function execution via Orleans I've seen in the documentation about how ""Orleans is not suited for long running work*"" (*Generally) - I may be paraphrasing.

4910,Access to declared state type in IGrainStorage,"The declared type of the grain state is not accessible via IGrainState.  The runtime type is however you can't determine the actual declared type. This causes problems when the state is of a derived type of the declared type.
e.g. in the IGrainStorage interface the only params you get about the state is IGrainState and if you need the declared type you're out of luck.

There's a hack available though. The implementation type of IGrainState is the internal 
and hope the grainState runtime type doesn't change.

I can suggest two options:
1 - Add **DeclaredStateType** parameter to IGrainStorage methods.
2 - Add DeclaredStateType to IGrainState. This does make the grain state object bigger and I don't know other places using IGrainState. So if there's no benefit other than this I would stay with the hack or give it a second thought.

4834,Questions about Reminders timing,"Hey there
In our team we are using Orleans Reminders to perform an action that should run exactly every 1 hour.
Reminders are registered with the following function: 
As we noticed recently a reminder that was registered with dueTime=0 period=1 hour will not tick every one hour exactly.
It will simply wait 1 hour _after the last reminder ended_ and then send the next reminder tick.
That is a problem to us since the reminder invokes a function that can take few seconds to end. In that case we will have an **accumulative delay** on reminder ticks that will be received every 1 hour **+ epsilon**.

From [Orleans Documentation](https://dotnet.github.io/orleans/1.5/Documentation/Core-Features/Timers-and-Reminders.html) it is said to be the case for Orleans Timers and for Reminders it said that ""Reminders are similar to timers [...]"".

My question is **whether there is an option to configure reminder timing** to be exactly as we registered (first tick after dueTime time and then a tick every period) without being affected by the duration of the function the reminder invokes.
If there isn't other solutions would be (A) making the reminder to invoke a async Task without awaiting for it (B) making the reminder to start a timer to do the actual work or (C) keeping track on the delay from the expected time and once it got too big update and re-schedule the reminder.

We'll be glad to hear if you know a way to handle it or simply what would you do in such cases :)

I am running the latest version of Orleans on a docker container based upon microsoft/dotnet:2.1-runtime on linux.

It's running at AWS in the ECS environment.

The problem seems to be related to Fallback serialization of exceptions. I make a call to an external library AmazonLambdaClient which is throwing a permissions exception. The permissions exception is a custom exception type and it seems that there is something wrong with serialization of this custom exception within docker on linux. 

For now my workaround is to catch the exception and convert it to a regular System.Exception but I'm guessing this problem will rear it's head somewhere else.

4826,Question/Sample Request: Long running function execution via Orleans,"I've seen in the documentation about how ""Orleans is not suited for long running work*"" (*Generally) - I may be paraphrasing. There are a few issues regarding that same topic #4531 #4370 #3071 and several others that I'm having trouble finding ATM.

The tldr of what I'm hoping to accomplish with Orleans is to take lots of calls from my app and dispatch them across a cluster of Orleans silos.  Many of these calls that occur are completed in a few milliseconds but many take several minutes to complete when running in our non-Orleans implementation.  

I understand there is a default timeout of 30 seconds for the client to receive a response from the grain and I would feel weird about increasing that to accommodate our ""longest running logic""  I feel like there has to be a better way of doing it that just increasing the timeout.

Currently my calls (either fast or slow) look similar to this and note this is all CPU bound work:

Client.cs
 in order to keep memory usage down; it seemed like I was getting into some situations where I'd have so many scheduled tasks that all memory would be utilized and nothing would complete.  

The above code does not work without setting the timeout to at least as high as our ""longest running operation"".  It seems that a lot of suggestions on getting around this are to ""return immediately that the task has been started then get the result when it's finished"" but I'm not finding any samples on how to accomplish this at least from both a client and grain perspective.

Could some samples be provided on how to accomplish what I'm going after?  It seems that some sort of check that an invocation is complete would be needed but I'm not sure how to go about that.  Would this require my grains to become stateful rather than stateless? #4370 seems like it ***may*** be of use but I'm only seeing from the grain perspective not what it looks like from the client.  Ideally my fast and long running client/grains with have similar looking implementations but if I have to break out into separate methods for accommodating that's fine as well.

Hopefully this all makes sense!","Question/Sample Request: Long running function execution via Orleans I've seen in the documentation about how ""Orleans is not suited for long running work*"" (*Generally) - I may be paraphrasing.

4795,"Named type ""Domain.Model"" is invalid: Type string ""Domain.Model"" cannot be resolved","Hi

I have this strange exception happening. It happens randomly about 50% of the time kind of sending goes fine then sending again triggers exception and so on. I found similar [issues](https://github.com/dotnet/orleans/issues/1536) from 2016. Some of the issues in the context of generic types. However the type I'm using is a plain C# (POCO) type.

Here is my scenario.

I want to share some of my data types (models) between solutions so I create a NuGet package that I install wherever I need the model. I do the same with interfaces (e.g. different solutions implements client to the same grain in some silo).

I've read the documentation [Serialization and Writing Custom Serializers](http://dotnet.github.io/orleans/Documentation/Advanced-Concepts/Serialization.html) about serialization but I can not see what I'm doing wrong. I do use ""DataContract"" attribute and also the ""Serializable"" attribute (as the document instruct me to use the ""Serializable"" attribute on types).

It is not clear from the documentation how I use other serializers (I see that it's possible to use other serializers instead of the one out-of-the-box - as long as all other parts of the environment uses the same serializer).

But now I've run out of ideas.

Here is the model that fails to be serialized (about 50% of the time):

 can't handle .NET Core version 2.1 (yet) all my solutions are locked to .NET Core version 2.0 (2.0.2). I'm using Orleans v2.0.3 and v2.0 throughout my (.NET Core) solutions.

I'd be happy to have some thoughts on why such a ""simple"" scenario fails. If it was consistent like failing all the time then I'd go with what the exception tells me that the type can not be resolved (not found) and work with it. But it is this scenario of the serializer failing on and off that I think is strange.

Thanks

How would you recommend configuring liveness for MAXIMUM availability?
Would appreciate specific suggestions for values adding the keys here for convenience:

* ProbeTimeout - The number of seconds to probe other silos for their liveness or for the silo to send ""I am alive"" heartbeat messages about itself. Default is 10 seconds.

* TableRefreshTimeout - The number of seconds to fetch updates from the membership table. Default is 60 seconds.

* DeathVoteExpirationTimeout - Expiration time in seconds for death vote in the membership table. Default is 120 seconds

* NumMissedProbesLimit - The number of missed ""I am alive"" heartbeat messages from a silo or number of un-replied probes that lead to suspecting this silo as dead. Default is 3.

* NumProbedSilos - The number of silos each silo probes for liveness. Default is 3.

* NumVotesForDeathDeclaration - The number of non-expired votes that are needed to declare some silo as dead (should be at most NumMissedProbesLimit). Default is 2.

* UseLivenessGossip - Whether to use the gossip optimization to speed up spreading liveness information. Default is true.

* IAmAliveTablePublishTimeout - The number of seconds to periodically write in the membership table that this silo is alive. Used only for diagnostics. Default is 5 minutes.

* NumMissedTableIAmAliveLimit - The number of missed ""I am alive"" updates in the table from a silo that causes warning to be logged. Does not impact the liveness protocol. Default is 2.

* MaxJoinAttemptTime - The number of seconds to attempt to join a cluster of silos before giving up. Default is 5 minutes.

* ExpectedClusterSize - The expected size of a cluster. Need not be very accurate can be an overestimate. Used to tune the exponential backoff algorithm of retries to write to Azure table. Default is 20.","Tuning Orleans table liveness for maximum availability Looking at this:

4758,Event hub stream provider questions,"Hi All

I have some questions regarding streaming in Orleans in general and specifically streaming using Event Hub Stream Provider.
I’ll briefly describe my scenario: I have a worker role (non-Orleans) that gets messages from an event hub. Each message belongs to some provider (there can be thousands of providers). The worker role then sends the message to a grain for this specific provider using streaming (there’s a separate stream for each provider grain). The processing of each message by the grain may take some time and that’s why I want to send the message over a persistent queue to decouple the sending from the handling of the message (unlike SMS provider). 
In addition there’s an accumulation of data in the grain itself and it in its turn sends the accumulated data to another service. That’s why I want the stream to be rewindable – if the silo crushed before the grain had sent the data batch I want to process the messages from the begging of the batch.
That’s why the event hub stream provider seems like the correct choice and that’s how I was thinking of using it:
When the first message of the batch arrives to the grain I will save its token in the (persisted) state of the grain. When the batch is sent I’ll update the token to the last message received and use a flag to indicate that I want to get messages with a newer token (the first message of the next batch). In this way if the silo crushes before I’ve sent the batch the grain will start processing messages from the last token saved.
1.	Can I consider event hub stream provider as ready for production systems? I don’t see any documentation for it but I see it’s been released long time ago and it’s been used by 343 industries.
2.	How many different streams does the event hub stream provider support? In the documentation states that “By default Orleans Streaming is targeted to support a large number of relatively small streams”. So it’s seems ok but I wanted to be sure.
3.	When I played with the event hub stream provider I tried to pass null to the StreamSequenceToken parameter on ResumeAsync expecting it to provider new events. But every time I started the Silo I got all the events that I previously sent. I have a workaround for this that I mentioned above but I’m wondering what the reason for this behavior is. 

Thanks!

4757,Incorrect silo shutdown behavior,"We're experiencing serious problems with a rolling update after migration to 2.0. Let me explain our architecture: we have a single heterogenous Azure queue processed by multiple workers (Competing Consumers pattern). Each message in this queue may be destined to a differrent actor. The setup is quite similar to how built-in Azure Queue Streaming Provider works. See diagram below.

![2018-07-11 12_06_43-untitled diagram xml - draw io](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107726/42562033-5785be38-8503-11e8-9e9e-055862a2d9c4.png)

Each node runs pulling agent (queue poller)  and the corresponding TPL DataFlow pipeline outside of the silo but within the same process with the silo (ie embedded). It could happen that recipent actor may reside on a different silo and so the client may forward the message to another silo which is normal of course. Also there number of other actors that may exchange messages across silos also normal of course since that's the whole point of having Orleans.

The problem arises when we try to shutdown the silo during rolling update. My expectation of Orleans' silo shutdown behavior when  raised by sibling nodes during each restart - I belive it's a topic of its own (perhaps retries could be advised as the solution).","Incorrect silo shutdown behavior We're experiencing serious problems with a rolling update after migration to 2.0.

4719,AzureStorage Reminders does not replace invalide path chars in Row and Partition Keys,"Hello

We've experienced an issue recently when our Orleans Cluster has been migrated to Service Fabric.
We are using AzureStorage Table Service for clustering GrainState persistence and Reminders.

As the sample shows us we use the ServiceName of the fabric as the ServiceId of the cluster.
(https://github.com/dotnet/orleans/blob/master/Samples/2.0/ServiceFabric/Stateless/StatelessCalculatorService/StatelessCalculatorService.cs )
> // The service id is unique for the entire service over its lifetime. This is used to identify persistent state
> // such as reminders and grain state.
> options.ServiceId = fabricServiceContext.ServiceName.ToString();

This works well for GrainState PartitionKey since invalid path chars like **/** or **\\** are replaced by underscores:


But this seems to be not the case for GrainReminders. 
A lot of 400 bad request errors occured because of the PartitionKey name containing invalid path chars. 

> The following characters are not allowed in values for the PartitionKey and RowKey properties:
> 
> The forward slash (/) character
> The backslash (\\) character
> The number sign (#) character
> The question mark (?) character
> Control characters from U+0000 to U+001F including:
> The horizontal tab (\t) character
> The linefeed (\n) character
> The carriage return (\r) character
> Control characters from U+007F to U+009F

The AzureTableReminderService should use the same sanitization mechanism for PartitionKeys and RowKeys of GrainReminders as GrainState.

It may be there are others that are not.

Currently the ADO.NET provider does not surface the options to load the library to the public configuration surface but instead uses a user-supplied (well-known) ADO.NET invariant to load libraries.

It could be beneficial to:
1. Consider that now that .NET Standard has again included  (such as if it's non-blocking or not)
3. give the user the option to supply the path to the connector dll to be loaded
4. and optionally create an utility function to extract the version of the library so it would become possible to just determine somewhat automatically if the library has certain properties such as truly non-blocking queries as-per some version.

What is interesting that the silo terminating in case when there is a startup task and orphan records in OrleansMembershipTable table I use ado.net membership.
If I remove orphan records from OrleansMembershipTable table or comment my startup task silo able to start and works.
Startup task activate a grain with reminder and timer for several background staff.

4664,Problem starting single silo cluster after ungraceful silo shutdown,"The default cluster membership options will have it take 10 minutes of failing to contact another silo before it can be marked dead but only 5 minutes for a new silo to attempt to join a cluster. This results in a 5 minute window where a new silo can't join the cluster if the previous silo(s) was ungracefully shutdown.
I can certainly change the timeouts in our application but I'm a) not super familiar with their function and b) wondering if the defaults should prevent that situation.

The other problem is that the new silo continues to run after failing to join and doesn't seem to try again. Perhaps I am missing some configuration or a try/catch but I would like to not leave a silo around in a broken state.","Problem starting single silo cluster after ungraceful silo shutdown The default cluster membership options will have it take 10 minutes of failing to contact another silo before it can be marked dead but only 5 minutes for a new silo to attempt to join a cluster.

4658,Expected GrainFactory behavior in a heterogeneous silos environment?,"Hi

I've set up [heterogeneous silos](http://dotnet.github.io/orleans/Documentation/Deployment-and-Operations/Heterogeneous-Silos.html) and verified that a client indeed doesn't need to know where grains are hosted (and that's fine).

However the scenario of agnostic grain invocation fails with the following setup:

- The environment is a cluster (I've used [Consul](https://www.consul.io/) as a membership provider)
- First silo has one grain of type 'A' (in my case it's a simple 'Hello' grain)
- Second silo has one grain of type 'B' (a simple 'AnotherHello' grain)
- Both interfaces and implementations are isolated (one assembly for each artifact - 4 projects)

The first grain 'A' has one responsibility to find and invoke grain 'B'. Grain 'B' logs a simple message ('AnotherHello').

The client begin the call chain by invoking 'A'.

When control hits 'A' it tries to resolve 'B' by using  then grains have to know what grains are hosted in the silo (agnostic grain invocation won't work) to avoid generating the exception.

Kind regards

4637,Orleans Client 1.5.2 issue with .NET PerformanceCounter constructor,"We (@amccool) have a Windows Service that is an Orleans Client. The service startup initializes the Orleans Client and on some VMs this is causing a timeout (from the Service Control Manager) and silent failure - no errors in logs (Orleans/text) no Windows Event other than the usual System one: ""A timeout was reached (30000 milliseconds) while waiting for the XXX service to connect"".

The program never has this issue when you run it on a command line it only fails like this as a service. The service is running as ""SYSTEM"" but changing the ""Log On"" has no effect . The program does not have this problem on every VM nor on my development machine.

I tracked the error down to the class RuntimeStatisticsGroup and its InitCpuMemoryCounters method. This line:

Orleans 1.5.2 sources [HERE](https://github.com/dotnet/orleans/blob/d5ea8dc4e0ef104562a05fe05ce9a3abb181c271/src/Orleans/Statistics/RuntimeStatisticsGroup.cs#L89).
_sometimes_ does not return within 30 seconds; pretty much ever-other-time I start the service about 50% of the time.

Sure enough if I hack the Orleans source to use the empty/default constructor then the service does not timeout on that line although I assume we would still eventually run into some kind of timeout once ""NextValue"" gets called - I haven't mangled my copy of the Orleans Client to test that yet. My hope would be that I can get the service started and whatever failure happens after that would at least get logged.

Is there some way to configure the ClientConfiguration to disable the Performance Counter setup? Windows Performance Counters are notoriously fragile and hard to work with...

4621,Stream data adapter,"Custom handling of the conversion of application data to and from the underlying queue is a common concern for users of  Orleans persistent streams.  There are many reasons for this:

* The default conversion logic does not handle schema changes for event data or changes to the Orleans data structures so if an application alters the contents of the persisted events or the Orleans team changes how the events are wrapped the old events will become unreadable.
* Without changes to the conversion application developers cannot read/process events using streaming for pre-existing queues or data written to queues by other processes.
* Without changes to the conversion application developers cannot write events in formats suitable for pre-existing systems or external consumers.

Some stream providers like azure queue memory and eventhub provide some support for custom data conversion but there is no common pattern and some patterns are quite painful.

Given that **_every_** internal service using Orleans persistent streams has had to customize their handling of queue data for one of the above reasons and in every case it’s made the use of Orleans persistent stream significantly more complicated I am of the opinion that addressing this should be a fairly high priority.","Stream data adapter Custom handling of the conversion of application data to and from the underlying queue is a common concern for users of  Orleans persistent streams.

Few queries on grain activation:

1) Lets assume we have an application deployed in a cluster of three silos. Client connected to a silo and have grain activation with it. And now if that silo goes down for some reason does orleans framework create entirely new grain activation in other silo? Will grain have new primary key?
2) I have been experimenting explict stream subscription with RabbitMQ. 

	And my application looke likes this:
	**SILOHOST** 

			1.  CommandBusGrain 	
                             1.  OnactivateAsync creates a stream (stream id: GUID.Empty)
                             2.  Register method does subscription to the stream
                             3.  Send method publish message to stream (that is _stream.OnNextAsync(msg))
			2.  On silo startup
                             1.  calls CommandBusGrain register method to initiate subscription
			
			
    **SILO Client**

			2.  Triggers ""Send"" method to publish message.

		
     This works fine but I need some suggestion on whether to call grain method to publish message to 
     the stream or create stream reference in the client and publish message directly to stream instead of 
     calling grain.
     Which one would be a better implementation?","Grain activation Hello
Few queries on grain activation:

1) Lets assume we have an application deployed in a cluster of three silos. Client connected to a silo and have grain activation with it. And now if that silo goes down for some reason does orleans framework create entirely new grain activation in other silo? Will grain have new primary key?
2) I have been experimenting explict stream subscription with RabbitMQ. 

	And my application looke likes this:
	**SILOHOST** 

			1.  CommandBusGrain 	
                             1.  OnactivateAsync creates a stream (stream id: GUID.Empty)
                             2.  Register method does subscription to the stream
                             3.  Send method publish message to stream (that is _stream.OnNextAsync(msg))
			2.  On silo startup
                             1.  calls CommandBusGrain register method to initiate subscription
			
			
    **SILO Client**

			1.  Create CommandBusGrain reference (Graind id: GUID.Empty)
			2.  Triggers ""Send"" method to publish message.

		
     This works fine but I need some suggestion on whether to call grain method to publish message to

4571,[WIP] Implementation of a DynamoDB-based gossip channel,"Hi

This is an attempt to bring DynamoDB as a gossip channel.
Still a work-in-progress but I think that some of the main components are now built.

Design is heavily inspired from the already-existing Azure-based gossip channel. I tried to keep the same conventions but feel free to ask me some changes if this does not comply with your dev rules.

Work is not over yet as
- not a single test has been done :)
- I have not yet used DynamoDB before so there may be design errors
- the gossip channel still has to be registered in the MultiClusterGossipChannelFactory

I have made the choice to split data into two different tables: one for the configuration and one for the gateway. This is not the way it has been implemented in the Azure channel but I am not at all familiar with AzureTable.
This may or may be not a good choice feel free to comment

Also a LegacyDynamoDBMembershipConfigurator has been used to parse DynamoDB connection string. I have to so as IGossipChannel's Initialize makes it mandatory. There may be better ways to do that","[WIP] Implementation of a DynamoDB-based gossip channel Hi

4556,Default provider pattern,"In the legacy provider model providers could be acquired by name or a system could request the default.  The default was the provider named “Default”.  When we moved to using dependency injection where keyed services were used instead of provider managers systems could resolve the provider by name as a keyed service or by the service type to get the default.
For example:

            IGrainStorage storageProvider = string.IsNullOrEmpty(providerName)
                ? services.GetServiceByName<IGrainStorage>(providerName)  // get by name or
                : services.GetService<IGrainStorage>(); // get default

To support the legacy naming conventions we continued using the pattern wherein naming a provider “Default” would signal that it’s the default provider.  This is supported by adding a mapping of the provider interface to the ‘default’ named service into the container.  Something like:

            services.TryAddSingleton<IGrainStorage>(sp => sp.GetServiceByName<IGrainStorage>(ProviderConstants.DEFAULT_STORAGE_PROVIDER_NAME));

This works but has some peculiarities.

* Users may not know about this rule and name a provider “Default” without knowing that name has special meaning in the system.
* Users may not register a default in which the default would always be null (or throw if GetRequiredServiceByName was called).
* The mapping to the default may be registered in the container multiple times which does no harm but is wasteful.

Questions:
Do we want to continue to support default providers?
If so how do we want them to work?
Does the above pattern fit our needs?
Is there a better pattern?

•	Not discoverable.  How do users know we have default json settings.
•	No way to modify the default.  Only per component overrides are provided.

4554,Orleans Persistence,"Orleans persists state for many reasons both in the core framework and extension libraries.  Persistent state introduces several concerns among which are:

•	Data partitioning.
•	Schema changes.
•	Supported backend storage systems.
•	Data migration and management tools.
•	Custom serialization.

Of the above issues some are addressed some are addressed inconsistently and others are not addressed.  This introduces risk to developers using Orleans because the ease of use hides the complexity associated with persisting state in an evolving production service.  The responsibility ultimately lives with the service developer but the way Orleans manages persistent state offers little to help developers be successful and can in some ways hinder them by hiding the risks.  Without addressing these concerns adding new features like Transactions or Indexing are more difficult and aggravate the problem while refactoring systems which have strong dependencies on storage like streaming or reminders are significantly hindered.

This issue is intended as a starting point for resolving these issues.  The problems are beyond what should be covered in a single issue so I suggest this thread be focused on identifying issues that need be solved which should be spun off as separate issues to be resolved independently.

To start the conversation:

*Data Partitioning*
Currently each silo is part of a cluster which is identified by a service Id which identifies the type of service running on the cluster and should remain constant through the life time of the service and a cluster Id which identifies a deployment of the service.  Storage is partitioned by the service Id.

*Schema Changes*
Storage is inconsistent in how data schemas are translated to storage but most persistence logic uses Orleans serialization to convert complex objects to byte arrays to be stored.  This does not support changes to the persisted state’s schema.  This both limits the Orleans team’s ability to improve Orleans without introducing breaking changes to customers (for which few options are available to work around) as well as application developers ability to modify their own persisted data schema’s when persisted using Orleans features.

*Supported backend storage systems*
We support abstractions for various components which allow for integration with different backends.  However these abstractions are not well defined enough for engineers to implement or program against them with clear expected behaviors.  For instance supported state size error handling and monitoring expectations are often unspecified and vary per implementation.  In more recent additions we’ve attempted to add test harnesses which can be used to vet the behaviors of implementations in an effort to standardize and formalize these abstraction layers but there is still much to be done.

*Data migration and management tools*
There is little to no support for cleaning up migrating or managing persisted state outside the context of the public abstractions.

*Custom serialization*
Custom serializers are primarily supported via the extensibility points in the serialization manager but the serialization manager was initially and primarily intended for networking serialization not storage which has different requirements.  Some other patterns have been attempted for special cases like streaming but no storage specific custom serialization pattern is in use uniformly in the system.

Thought/comments?

We are thinking about using a similar API to the one I created in OrleansTestKit but run it within the actual Orleans runtime. The OrleansTestKit is able to run tests for many simple use cases however it will not support more complex grain that are deeply integrated with Orleans for example Lifecycle events. There are many other things that Orleans does that would not be able to be tested inside the TestKit. Rather than spending more time emulating Orleans behaviors we are thinking about a new approach that would allow the same assertions that exist within the current TestKit but would allow grain code to execute exactly as it does when running in a real silo.

 In reality most of this proposal is just to allow developers to assert grain state  grain calls to other grains and provide a way for a developer configure a mock grain that will return the desired value or exception when a grain is called.

What would need to be built:

**Storage provider**
- Assert the current grain state
- Setup the grain state prior to activation

**Stream provider**
- Assert that a grain is subscribed to a specific stream
- Assert that a grain sends the proper message on a stream
- Assert that a grain received a message from a stream without error
- Assert that a grain unsubscribed from a specific stream

**Reminder Provider**
- Assert that a reminder was registered for the correct time
- Fire a reminder on demand from within a test 

**Mock Grain Call Filter**
- Assert that another grain was called with the correct values
- Intercept grain-to-grain method calls and return a specific value or throw an exception

**Other**
- Deactivate a grain on demand
- Activate a grain on demand

I thought that automatic scanning for assemblies was the default behaviour - ref [Application Parts documentation](https://dotnet.github.io/orleans/Documentation/Deployment-and-Operations/Configuration-Guide/Server-Configuration.html#application-parts) and https://github.com/dotnet/orleans/issues/4420#issuecomment-379962127 .

> Overhaul of code generation. **While mostly invisible for developer** code generation became much more robust in handling serialization of various possible types. Special handling is required for F# assemblies. See Code generation section for more details.

Code generation is not very invisible given that Orleans won't work without it - ref https://github.com/dotnet/orleans/issues/4417 .",P1,sergeybykov,,

it is a little bit vague but I have the impression that Orleans gets slower over time.

My specs are:

* Co-Hosted with ASP.NET Core

I have a very simple grain that just returns the snapshot (my own state system):

https://github.com/Squidex/squidex/blob/master/src/Squidex.Domain.Apps.Entities/Schemas/SchemaGrain.cs#L305

I use my own serializer with JSON.NET and my benchmarks show that the serialization takes 2-3 ms usually. I also tested it with 100x larger states that expected and the performance is great.

I added some profiling to the client side and I have experienced that the call takes 4-5 ms after I deploy it and several days later up to 200ms or even more (the max I have seen is 10seconds).

I also checked my MongoDB logs where I save all slow queries and there is nothing related.

is it possible to make Heterogenous Silos configuration by supplying the same build package with all grain implementations but configuring which parts to host by AddApplicationParts or any similar way (but still referencing all grains)?
We are just considering to supply the silo with some config and select required set of grains ( and dependent services to inject etc. ) to host when starting the silo. 
It will be very useful if you have the silo capable of hosting N feature-sets and when the demand arises for some parts of functionality/services you can choose for which features you need to allocate more resources (and resource configurations required) and start additional silos only for these instead of running the one big silo.

4458,Questions related to reliability,"Your implementation of the Actor pattern is obviously more geared around intuitiveness and implicit reliability than other implementations.  I do really like how intuitive things are however have 2 questions:

1. You obviously support streams which means one grain can fire off some request into a stream and then exit.  My question is; should streams be optional?  My understanding from reading the docs is that the most simple and intuitive route to follow is to not use them and to block (asynchronously) while dependant grains execute. However I think that I could easily get into more trouble using Orleans in this way than I would by developing traditional locking code.

Say I have a Grain A which depends on Grain B which depends on Grain C etc.  If Grain C maintains state but A and B don't then are potential activations of A and B blocked until C completes even though work could be performed in A and B during this period - perhaps A and B don't even always lead to C.

Hopefully it's clear what I'm trying to say.  In a sentence it makes perfect sense to make grains atomic however I'm not so sure about chains of grains.  

Have I misinterpreted the architecture? Assuming I haven't I'll repeat that I know I can use streams and there will be certain patterns I can follow to help me here.  I'm just wondering if there is any value in going the simple/intuitive route (if indeed it's better than a more traditional approach)?

2. I understand why streams are reliable and it's very nice to have this.  I'm not clear how to best use them though.  I'll give an example to demonstrate my question - along with some extra detail so you can correct me if I'm missing something fundamental:

Grain A posts a message to Stream A (it blocks while it's posting to the stream but after this can then return and handle further activations).  Now if for whatever reason the message posted to the stream isn't processed as expected (e.g. the grain which consumes the message doesn't die but somehow drops the message).  I'm assuming I have to build checks into my system for this type of thing?

If it is the case that I've got to build these checks into my system I'm wondering if it's worth paying the cost for the reliable stream?","Questions related to reliability Your implementation of the Actor pattern is obviously more geared around intuitiveness and implicit reliability than other implementations.

I'm new to orleans. I wonder if there are any useful scenarios using Orleans.
The only scenario i can think of this moment is ticketing service.
One of my customers have ticketing service for concerts.
When they host famous singer's concert they receive lots of traffic in
very short amounts of time like Ddos attacks.
As a results sometimes bottleneck is web servers sometimes it's database.
I think Orleans will help to mitigate this situation.
So i have two questions.

1.  Are there any other useful scenarios ?
2.  If I had to convert a traditional three-tier(webapidb) application into Orleans 
    what would it be changed? I know that this is a broad question but please give me 
    any descriptions or link to help me understand the general idea.
   (ex - Azure's table storage is recommended than traditional Relational Database)

Thanks.

We are running 2 small sized worker roles (Orleans 2.0) and client app service (ASP.Net core) also networked as per the [documentation](http://dotnet.github.io/orleans/Documentation/Deployment-and-Operations/Using-Azure-Web-Apps.html) App service and orleans silo(cloudservice) share same vNET and configured the subnet of vNET to Network security group. Both workerrole and appservice use same clusterId and serviceId.

1. I need to do some piece of work in the Start method.
2. After run some method (ExecuteTransaction) without waiting and immediately return some result (in this example value which will notify that process has been successfully started).

What is the right way to do it? Use async void method or one more additional grain? Is async void bad practice here?

Also sometimes I'm getting Orleans.Storage.TableStorageUpdateConditionNotSatisfiedException in the 
ExecuteTransaction() method. I put two breakpoints in this method:

1. At the beginning of method.
2. After block of // Step 2.

The second breakpoint hits two times without stack trace when first only once. How it is possible magic?

4308,Does this make sense for Orleans or SF and if so guidance please,"We’re working to take our  software to Azure cloud and looking at Orleans and Service Fabric (SF) as potential frameworks.  We need to:

1)	Populate our analysis engines with lots of data (e.g. 100MB to 2GB) per engine instance.
2)	Maintain that state and if an engine instance goes idle for say 20 minutes or more we’d like to unload it (i.e. and not pay for the engine instance resource).
3)	Each engine instance will support one to several end users with a specific data set.
4)	Each engine instance can be highly interactive generating lots of plot data near realtime.  We’re maintaining state as we don’t want to pay the price to populate engine instance for each engine interaction.
5)	An engine instance action can take a few seconds a few minutes to even tens of minutes.  We’ll want some feedback.
6)	Users may access an engine instance every few seconds (e.g. to steer the engine towards a result based on feedback) and will want live plot data.
7)	Each user will want to talk to a specific engine instance.
8)	As a user expresses interest in running a simulation (i.e. standing up an engine instance) ideally we want him to choose small/medium/large computing resource to run his engine instance (i.e. based on the problem he’s trying to solve he may want more or less computing/memory power).

We’re considering Orleans and SF but we’re having difficulty specifying architecture based on above requirements.  We’ve considered:

1)	Trying to think about an SF node or an Orleans silo as an ‘engine instance’ described above.
2)	Leveraging both Orleans and SF notion of fault tolerance through replication.
3)	Leveraging local (i.e. to node or silo) storage to store results and maintain state (i.e. for long periods or until idle for 20 minutes).

We’ve not understood how to:

1)	Limit a silo or a node to a single engine instance so that we can control resourcing of the engine instance.
2)	Keep a user’s engine instance data separate from another users engine instance data.  
3)	Direct a request from a user (e.g. through a web API) to a particular engine instance.

Does this make sense for Orleans does it make more sense for SF?  Any pointers on how to implement the above would be helpful.

One of my grain uses RabbitMq to receive messages.
The moment I reference the NuGet pacakge RabbitMQ.Client v5.0.1 (.NET 4.5.1) and used a type from the package in a grain the this error comes up:

4283,WorkGroup X took elapsed time and Task pressure,"I've been investigating grain client timeouts and with that a large number of WorkGroup timeout warnings. After a fair amount of logging commenting and digging around I think I've distilled it down into being Task pressure on the scheduler. I'll try to describe out scenario summarize the investigatory steps and findings and then provide a simple example that results in the same warnings.

# Our Usage
We use Orleans as a means of importing normalizing processing and ultimately storing data from external data sources into a cloud based database. Additionally as new data and updates to old data come in we update external clients with the normalized and processed data.

Each document that comes in has a primary key to which we use to create an import grain. This import grain does some work to map external source IDs to normalized ones and then passes the normalized data to a ""model"" grain who's primary key is the mapped external primary key. These ""model"" grains use a custom storage provider that reads/writes to the cloud based database. This call also calls update on registered observers which end up flowing through to externally connected clients subscribed to document changes.

That's a pretty brief description of what we're trying to accomplish. I can dig into how we're doing it if necessary but I don't want to get side tracked on the approach yet.

# Investigations
- Eliminated possible blocking calls (Task.Run all the things)
- Added logging with timestamps around turns (start stop and around await calls)
- Added logging to the database to check query times

## Findings
- The timing logs ended up not really correlating well to any of the ""WorkGroup X took elapsed time""
- The timing logs showed pretty random and sporadic long duration tasks (explained below)

### Sporadic long-running tasks
One of the best examples I encountered was when investigating some long execution database calls in a WriteStateAsync call to a storage provider. Generally the database call would take 100-150ms (keep in mind these are called via Task.Run). The database's logs were showing 10-40ms for the actual query. While attempting to determine the difference here I noticed that individual statements in the code would sometimes very dramatically in how long they ""took"" and the query itself was not always the thing that took 100-150ms. An example is:

1. Do some small amount of work
2. Do some other small amount of work
3. Build a 200-300 character string using $"""" interpolation
4. Execute query

""Generally"" step 4 would take 100-150ms; however _sometimes_ steps 1 or 2 or 3 would take 150ms and step 4 would take 10-40ms.

### Conclusions
So based on that I put together a simple grain call that generates a bunch of Tasks and I end up seeing the same ""WorkGroup X took elapsed time"" warnings.

### Is this normal and/or expected?
We do generate a number of tasks throughout many of our grains. Not an inordinately large number but it's probably 1-10 per document.

I would expect this type of behavior spinning up a large number of threads that would then end up having to compete for CPU core time. Thus I feel like this is probably normal given a large number of Tasks would end up competing for Thread time? What seems strange to me; however is that the warning message implies the WorkGroup was _started_ preempted and then completed.

# Simple Example
## Grain Client
The client just calls a grain's Echo method 100 times. Each iteration is a new grain.

4275,WIP - More aggressively cleanup system target stream producers.,"This is part of a follow-up on stream rebalancing issues raised by @ilyalukyanov in Stream resubscription issues #3484.

The concern was that inactive system target stream producers were not being cleaned up in the pubsub state leading to streams that could no longer be subscribed to or unsubscribed from.

There is an issue here though I am unconvinced it is the cause of the behaviors @ilyalukyanov is seeing.  This conclusion comes from the fact that in @ilyalukyanov's scenario silos were being killed so the system target stream producers on those silo by the existing logic should be cleaned up.  The system target stream producers that where rebalanced would have unregistered as part of the queue rebalancing.  Only if the unregister operation had failed would this bug manifest.  That would have shown up in the logs.

This PR is marked WIP because it's not yet obvious that this is the right fix.  It's not clear under what conditions the OrleansMessageRejectionException is returned.  The GetApproximateSiloStatus check implies that it was expected that there was a possibility for OrleansMessageRejectionException to be received when the producer was still valid and I've yet been unable to rule this out.  The cost of getting this wrong is that healthy producers could be removed thus no longer be notified of subscription changes on that stream.","WIP - More aggressively cleanup system target stream producers.

We'd welcome recommendations for high-priority additions e.g. ones you had to implement in your app due to a lack of built-in Orleans support. We have two questions. First what types of query expressions are most important? For example:
 
1.	Select grains in a grain class satisfying a {< ≤> ≥} predicate on a property. E.g. Employee.Salary < 100K. This requires adding B-trees to Orleans.Indexing which currently supports only hash indexes. 
 
2.	Top-K query over a group of grains in a grain class. E.g. top-10 players in a game grouped by game type which is a property of the game grain-type.
 
3.	Aggregate queries i.e. count sum max min average over a collection. E.g. number of devices of each device type where device type is a property of the device grain-type.
 
4.	Path queries. E.g. a list of teams that have a member M with M.Languages containing ""F#"" where Team is a grain-type that has a collection-valued property called Members and Member is a grain type with a collection-valued property called Languages.
 
Second over which set of grains can a query be executed? For example:
 
5.	Queries over all initialized grains of one or more grain-types where grains are mapped to persistent storage.
 
6.	Same as (5) but one or more of the grain types is not persisted.
 
7.	Queries over active grains only.  
 
8.	Queries over streams with a window function. E.g. all devices that reported a failure in the last 5 minutes.
 
9.	Materialized views. For a given query maintain its result in the face of updates to the underlying grains. E.g. a count of the number of faulty devices of each device type (which is a grain class).

4217,Grains on SiloA deactivated because of SiloB shutting down,"Hi there.

I've found an issue where app grains on one silo are often being deactivated because another silo shut down. This seems like a serious reliability problem to me as any grain can essentially be deactivated anywhere in the cluster at any time even though their hosting silo is not affected.

Hoping this is not expected behaviour as any grain that uses timers and does not regularly receive messages could be deactivated in this way.

It's easy to reproduce (see steps at end) and I have been able to repro in v1.5.1 and v1.5.3 using memory and azure table storage (via emulator).

Here are the entries in the log that precede the deactivation:

* Start the Azure Storage Emulator. Alternatively rename the included OrleansConfiguration_memorystorage.xml and OrleansConfiguration2_memorystorage.xml files to OrleansConfiguration.xml and OrleansConfiguration2.xml respectively.
* Start Debug session.
* Wait for first silo to start successfully and for one of the messages to be logged e.g. ""Processing message 'some message' in grain ...""
* Open command line in bin/Debug directory.
*## Start the second silo by executing ""OrleansHost.exe SecondSilo OrleansConfiguration2.xml"".
* Wait for this second silo to start logging ""Processing message 'some message' in grain ..."". This indicates that a grain on the second silo is also now receiving messages.
* Press Ctrl+C to stop second silo.
* About 60% of the time the grain sending the messages (which started on the first silo) will be shut down because of the second silo being stopped. The other 40% of the time the grains on the second silo will be activated on the first silo and everything continues working as expected.

- For ImplicitStreamSubscriptions there is a great amount of housekeeping that the developer must do to subscribe to its own stream and unsubscribe resume and such.

4128,How to let timers survive a (graceful) silo shutdown,"I have a Game grain which manages the logic for a turn-based game between two players. Inside this grain a timer is used to measure the time for each turn and forcefully end a player's turn if they fail to play in a timely manner.

If this grain gets deactivated (even gracefully) the timer will cease to exist. The creation of a new activation of this grain will depend on it receiving external calls which means it may not happen until one of the players makes a move which defeats the purpose of the timer. I can save the game's state and let it continue off from where the old silo was shut down but I currently have no way of bringing the timer back online.

One way is to constantly poll the grain from another grain. This fails because the other grain is also subject to the same limitations as the original (namely it may get deactivated with no way to restore its timers).

Another way is to have a second grain (let's call it pinger). One could have the game ask the pinger (on deactivation) to call it back after a second or so. This is likely to succeed most of the time but if the pinger happens to be on the same silo and get deactivated after the game it will still fail.

Yet another may be to have the game call itself. However I'm not entirely sure this is a stable solution as I don't know how the silos handle the case of a grain receiving a call while it's already deactivating but not yet fully deactivated. If the grain is removed from the global directory *before* the OnDeactivateAsync call this may succeed. I just thought of this while writing this question so I have yet to see if this actually works.

A reminder is not appropriate in this scenario because the minimum interval for a reminder is 60 seconds IIRC. An entire turn takes about half a minute.

Any other ideas on how to handle this (and other similar cases)?","How to let timers survive a (graceful) silo shutdown I have a Game grain which manages the logic for a turn-based game between two players.

Now the configuration of those components has scattered in three places one is through inheritance another one is through giant god  stream provider options which is intended to configure everything third one is through the component's own option. All three of them has pain points listed below. 

- Use inheritance  instead of DI to configure some core component such as . This make configuring harder since if user want to configure those they need to actually have a reasonable understanding of how Orleans streaming is wired up internally to know which class to inherit and when to set those factories. Although this is true before so one may argue it might be fine now. But the fact is after provider been integrated with lifecycle its configuration process has been changed entirely. For users who configured those factory through inheritance they cannot use our extension methods to configure their custom stream provider and the configuration their are familiar with is gone and they need to get used to a new one which is almost as bad as before. So I think we should kill this pain point because we provided a new configuration method it will suck if it is as bad as before. 

- The disadvantage of god stream provider options is its poor flexibility extensibility and complexity. I will skipped listing its cons here since I think there's a consensus on Why god configuration is bad. 

- Configure one component through its own option is the way to go forward. The problem with it right now is poor discoverability especially when the configuration is in three places. For example to configure a queue balancer now you need to first set the queue balancer type right in the stream provider options then you need to configure the specific type of queue balancer options through DI which there's no extra infrastructure to guide you on how to do that. 

I would argue some of those need to be improved in 2.0 scope because we create a fuss to provide a new way of configuration it will be bad if this new configuration method is as bad as before and user need to learn about this new bad way and adapt to it instead of happily adapt a better way. 

General direction is to uniform these three ways of configuration and develop one consistent and better way to configure stream providers which also has good discoverability extensibility and flexibility.

**Setup:**
- 8 machines
- Each machine runs one Silo and one Client
- The Client takes messages off a MSMQ and forwards it to the Cluster
- Using SQL membership
- This is our development system so no hardware or windows firewalls are on

**Observed behaviour**
- Communication issues happened at the same time
- Some clients work normally
- Some clients fail to talk to the cluster (log below)
- When a client fails to send data no data can be sent from that client at all (we allow up to messages sent to Orleans simultaneously)
- Clients failed within 30-60 minutes of each other
- The clients that fail fail on a ""known"" error.  I.e. an Orleans exception is thrown the client retries to send its data forever.

If we ask our user to configure them then we run risks of low discoverability of the need to configure them and mysterious performance drop after adopting 2.0. 

Default MinThreads for ThreadPool is small while Orleans needs hundreds of threads to have optimal performance.

- Message.cs contained a bug that made the IsReturnedFromRemoteCluster flag not work correctly. This could also cause excessive forwarding and failure to remove stale directory cache entries.
- in two places NullReferenceExceptions were thrown when multi-clusters had no gateways reporting. I put in the proper handling of these situations.
- some tests were failing because the gsi-directory-maintenance was happening too late. To fix this I changed the periodic maintenance loop so it  runs the maintenance immediately after each multi-cluster-configuration change.

I also fixed some tracing issues and added more tests to the Functional category so we can cover these types of errors in regression.

When this change is implemented it needs to be ensured all places are modified and the current code does not assume _well known_ ports. Assuming all places are changed to use system given free ports failing tests should reveal places that assume _well known_ ports.

One option to refactor the tests could be to implement a cache or a DI-like container to (lazily) generate and hold parameters that are then injected in all test class constructors.

3848,[Question] Streams limitations lots of subscribe/unsubscribes,"I'm trying to use orleans streams to manage channel subscriptions in a websocket server. What happens is when sockets are connected the server will ask a grain to give back a stream Id. The socket server (orleans client) then creates a subscription to that stream. Now these are a lot of subscriptions/unsubscriptions and when the numbers grow I start to receive lots of exceptions on the client side when adding a message to the stream. SerializationExceptions to be exact.

Now my question is does the runtime sends a message from the silo for each subscription on the client side or one message will be sent to the client and then the client forwards it to all local subscribers?
And on the broader sense is using streams in this way a good choice for this scenario?

_I'm using SMS provider with fire and forget and a memory storage provider for pubsubstore._

Things I've already tried to find the cause:
- Made stream messages Immutable. This was actually the way it was from the beginning this leads to NullReferenceExceptions which made me think maybe the message is disposed (well not technically speaking).
- Added ILBasedSerializer for fallback serializer. No help to get the actual exception message.","[Question] Streams limitations, lots of subscribe/unsubscribes I'm trying to use orleans streams to manage channel subscriptions in a websocket server.

Now my question is does the runtime sends a message from the silo for each subscription on the client side or one message will be sent to the client and then the client forwards it to all local subscribers?
And on the broader sense is using streams in this way a good choice for this scenario?

_I'm using SMS provider with fire and forget and a memory storage provider for pubsubstore._

Things I've already tried to find the cause:
- Made stream messages Immutable. This was actually the way it was from the beginning this leads to NullReferenceExceptions which made me think maybe the message is disposed (well not technically speaking).
- Added ILBasedSerializer for fallback serializer. No help to get the actual exception message.",,xiazen,,

3841,How to create a reader-writer grain with parallel reads,"I'm facing an issue similar to what is discussed (but not resolved) in #1468. Basically I need a reader-writer grain(s?) to hold some values so other parts of the system can reference them frequently and in parallel.

What I'm after is storing some system-wide config values which are accessed frequently and subject to change but only *extremely* rarely (once a month or so at most). The system should be reconfigurable without downtime. What I'm currently considering is to store the data in some database. Then it will be read at silo startup and there will be a special callback to read the data again after it changes externally. I don't want to read the data from the database every time I need it because:

1. It'll create unnecessary processing overhead inside the silo as some of the data must be processed and filtered out.
2. It'll increase load on the database which I cannot guarantee will be as good at handling high load as the silo environment.
3. The data is verified by the silo environment before it is updated. Reading directly from the database means there will be no middle layer to hold the last known valid data while the operator updates and fixes the new data.

I can easily create a reader-writer locked in-memory data store but Orleans' single-threaded execution policy doesn't allow parallel access to the grain that holds the data. I can think of the following ways to bypass this:

1. Have multiple copies of the data inside multiple grains. This is obviously not optimal.
2. Use static fields to store the data and make the grain a stateless worker. This means every silo has its own copy of the data (which also helps with reducing network load) but there is no means of asking every *silo* to update its copy of the data (that I know of at least).

Suggestions?
