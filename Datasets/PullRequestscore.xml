        <Title>Linux prereq link is broken</Title>
        <Description># Issue Title

Be as descriptive as you can with your title.

# General

Provide details on the problem you are experiencing including the .NET Core version, operating system version and anything else that is relevant.

Please provide a code sample for your issue if it is relevant, either inline, link to a gist (or similar) or add it as a zipped attachment.

For some issues, you will get a quicker and better response if you file it at a more specific [.NET repo](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/Documentation/core-repos.md). For example, if the problem is with ASP.NET Core, you are encouraged to use the [aspnet/home repo](https://github.com/aspnet/home/issues).


I am having an issue with the link in this part of the documentation: https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/Documentation/prereqs.md

When I click on the Linux prerequisites, I do not see anything.</Description>

        <Title>.NET Core Release Data (releases.json) Redesign and Deprecation </Title>
        <Description># .NET Core Release Data (releases.json) Redesign and Deprecation

The releases.json and releases.csv files began life as helper tools for some of our internal release work, some experimentation and to possibly be useful to the community. It has been great to learn the files are indeed in use and many folks depend on them as a trigger for a number of activities.

* [release-notes/releases.json](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/releases.json)
* [release-notes/releases.csv](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/releases.csv)

Between the usages which we have become aware and in considering further activities that could be enabled to reason about things such as checking .NET Core version availability and support status, it became clear the current format is inadequate.

An updated format has been designed and tested which will replace the current files. The timeline below describes the path to obsoleting the current files.

## The Plan

| Date | Action |
| :--- | :----- |
| Oct 2018 | Notify the community of the coming change |
| Oct 2018 | Release the new json format into dotnet/core |
| Oct 2018 - Feb 2019 | Maintain the old json and csv files |
| Feb 2019 | Reminder announcement that old format file is coming soon |
| Mar 2019 | Old json and csv files are obsoleted and removed from dotnet/core |

## Breaking change

If you are currently utilizing the old version json or csv, you will need to update the relevant code to work with the new format. If you are just getting started with consuming this data, use the new version.

## The Format

Below are fragments of the files from our most recent .NET Core release.

### release-index.json

This file consists of a top level array with data on the latest release versions and a property for locating the more detailed channel-specific releases.json. This file is found in [dotnet/core/release-notes](https://github.com/dotnet/core/tree/new-json/release-notes/)

[releases-index.json](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/new-json/release-notes/releases-index.json)

    <Title>Improve wording on comment editing</Title>

        <Title>Outdated statement about comment edit histories</Title>
        <Description>https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/Documentation/contributing/maintainers.md

Currently states:

&gt; **Maintainers won't**
&gt;
&gt; * Edit contributor comments as a general rule. GitHub comments don't provide edit history and therefore don't offer maintainers a transparent and accurate way to describe changes made to contributor comments. Transparency is a cornerstone of effective discourse and its absence undermines trust.

This was changed in May. 

https://blog.github.com/changelog/2018-05-24-comment-edit-history/

I'm not advocating that maintainers should or should not edit contributor comments, but this statement as it stands is no longer correct.</Description>

Shouldn't this [page][download-archive] have a link to download the SDK for Fedora 24?
There's info about the tar file in the [checksums][checksums], but there's no download link.

        <Title>Visual Studio for Mac .NET Core 2.0 issues are out of date</Title>
        <Description># Visual Studio for Mac .NET Core 2.0 issues are no longer true with VS for Mac 7.1

[Known issues for .NET Core 2.0 document](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/2.0/2.0.0-known-issues.md) has a couple of references to Visual Studio for Mac which are out of date:

``

The above section links to a set of [issues](https://gist.github.com/mrward/70b8132003ef77d893111ecbea3e2225) which only apply to VS for Mac 7.0 so we should probably remove the above section.

        <Title>Visual Studio Preview 4 (7.0 Build 1566) has broken link for downloading .NET core</Title>
        <Description>Just installed Visual Studio Preview 4 on my Mac and attempted to create a .NET Core Web API project, it detected that I don't have .NET core installed and directed me to Github link below to download it which is broken:
https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/rc4-download.md

I know this is not strictly a .NET core issue, but I'm not sure about the repository to report this into.  If you let me know, I will report it accordingly.</Description>

    <Title>Add .csproj based samples</Title>
    <Description>The csproj based samples were added which were derived by running the `dotnet migrate` command. I've also updated the Markdown documentation to mention specific usage of the .NET Tooling versions as I understand them and how the relate to the two main existing project file formats for .NET Core.

This PR was created to resolve [issue #5154](https://github.com/dotnet/cli/issues/5154) which points out an inconsistency that I noticed in the documentation which points out that the newer builds of the CLI Tools only work with .csproj based projects but then goes on to suggest the reader follow the project.json samples.</Description>
