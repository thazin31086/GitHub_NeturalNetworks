    <Title>Exception thrown when trying to encrypt an EnvelopedCms with a Diffie-Hellman certificate if it uses AES as the symmetric cipher</Title>
    <Description>Currently the only test that there is using a Diffie-Hellman certificate for encryption is using the default cipher Triple DES CBC. However if the cipher used is changed to any of the AES variants the Windows implementation throws Internal.Cryptography.CryptoThrowHelper+WindowsCryptographicException : The parameter is incorrect. within method Internal.Cryptography.Pal.Windows.PkcsPalWindows.EncodeHelpers.CreateCryptMsgHandleToEncode
