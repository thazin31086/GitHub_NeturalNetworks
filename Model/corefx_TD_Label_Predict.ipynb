              "       'Remove allocations from Dns   This started as an effort to reduce the size of  System Net NameResolution dll  when publishing a trimmed app   It s not that big to begin with but it s carrying around a copy of all of the  IAsyncResult  helper types because the  Get Async  methods are currently wrappers for the  Begin End   methods   This PR inverts that wrapping the  Begin End   methods instead around the  Get Async  methods using the same  TaskToApm  helper we use in other places in corefx for the same purpose   This makes the  Get Async  methods faster and lighter weight but it does increase the number amount of allocation in the  Begin End   APIs   Since these are considered legacy I normally would consider that a good trade however we still use these  Begin End  methods in a few places in  System Net Sockets dll   which should be fixed later  and I didn t want to regress those use cases   So this also then trims some additional fat which helps the  Get Async  cases even further and gets the  Begin End   to be even better than before the change   This includes not allocating an  IPHostEntry  when we re just going to unwrap it and return its addresses computing the exact  IPAddress    size we need rather than using a  List    to grow it and  ToArray  to create the actual array avoiding creating the  HostName  if we don t need it avoiding an unnecessary  SafeHandle  allocation and avoiding a closure allocation in the  TaskToApm  helpers   As part of this I also noticed that we had some bugs in how some of our interop structures on Windows were defined   In particular fields that in the native types were size t were defined as int rather than IntPtr in the managed code  this appears to be carry over from when the types were only used with the    bit variants    It appears we ve been saved from corruption by padding but I fixed it regardless   And as long as I was changing pretty much everything else where I was touching code I also cleaned up some legacy style stuff     Size    In an app published as trimmed that just uses HttpClient to download a page prior to this change System Net NameResolution dll was   K  after this

              "       'Consider creating an IndexSet Type Now that C    has  Ranges  https   docs microsoft com en us dotnet api system range view netstandard      perhaps it is time to consider adding an  IndexSet  type  An IndexSet is a sorted collection of unique unsigned non contiguous integers generally represented as Ranges  For ex  The following IndexSet contains     integers in   Ranges   IndexSet anIndexSet                                            This is potentially useful in a number of applications  For ex  Http response codes in the  xx range are usually a success of some kind  A call such as  HttpResponseSuccessIndexSet Contains       is trivial to do with an IndexSet  An IndexSet can also be used to store indices into other data structures  Other examples would be to return a set of Ranges from a  D  D matrix return a set of rows from a table Ranges of enum values etc      Rationale   Compared to storing entire sets of integers in a dictionary an IndexSet      Uses less memory     Can efficiently answer questions about intersections and membership     Can efficiently return an index that is greater equal lesser than a specified index     Always has the same ordering sorted     supports iteration over the indices potentially applying delegates    Note  An IndexSet is NOT efficient when storing arbitrary integers because each index will be stored as a Range Note  An IndexSet also stores only   instance of an index    An API Sketch      C   code  public class ReadOnlyIndexSet   IEnumerable Range                public ReadOnlyIndexSet Range range

easy enough to achieve with the currently proposed APIs    Tagging  safern since he owns Systems Collections Specialized and this feels like a good fit  Looking forward to hearing the community s thoughts around this     Discussion      What s the advantage of an IndexSet over SortedSet Range   Memory essentially  As the number of indexes stored as Ranges  increases an IndexSet uses lesser memory compared to a SortedSet  An IndexSet is more specialized than a SortedSet HashSet Set of Range because any modifications work on the underlying ranges  Hopefully the following examples make it clear   IndexSet myIndexSet   new IndexSet                      myIndexSet Add        myIndexSet will now hold          myIndexSet Add             myIndexSet will hold           If I instead used a Set Range  for the same ops depending on the Set comparator I might end up with   Set Range  myset   new Set Range                       myset Add        myset will now hold                     myset Add            myset will hold                              Removing an index from an IndexSet makes the difference more apparent   IndexSet myIndexSet   new IndexSet                      myIndexSet Remove        myIndexSet will now hold                      With a Set Range  to remove from the middle of a Range I d have to first remove the range containing   i e         from the set split it into     and        and then re add them to the Set      ',\n",

              "       'DotNetCore       is slow on connecting and publish messages to AWS AMQ DotNetCore       on linux takes a long time to make connections and publish messages to AWS AMQ    General We run dotnetcore in containers on our OpenShift cluster  Most recently they failed on all environments because they can no longer connect to AWS AMQ  It feels like it s running against a timeout of something  This issue  only  occurs when running dotnetcore on linux   My linux guest system is an ubuntu         see  dotnet   info  below    It also occurs on RHEL   containers  I eliminated the network as culprit    I can connect from my windows machine but it takes a long time from my linux guest OS in the same machine    My linux guest OS can connect and post messages to AWS AMQ from a java program   fast      I asked our network guy to allow outgoing network traffic from my machine to that specific instance    I used wireshark to monitor the network traffic from my PC to see if it connected somewhere else   which it didn t     I eliminated AWS AMQ as the culprit    The AWS logs show no sign of something wrong   The same queue works in a java   We set up a different queue from scratch and the issue still occurs   Wireshark shows pauses of    seconds at certain intervals  It is consistently around   seconds so it does feel like a timeout of some sort    Wireshark shows dotnetcore connecting with TLS     connection in both windows   linux using the same cipher suite   TLS ECDHE RSA WITH AES     CBC SHA    When executing the same code on windows it can connect just fine  When trying to connect to the AWS AMQ in java it is able to connect fine as well   The only remaining  culprit  I can think of is something going wrong in the dotnetcore runtime itself unless I am missing something   Below you have a C  code sample   taken from the amazon documentation    Building and running on windows   it works perfect  Build and running on Linux   It takes forever to connect and post messages       s      Note  I just noticed there is a slight version difference between my linux   windows regarding dotnetcore  I will update it and try that as well and add it as
