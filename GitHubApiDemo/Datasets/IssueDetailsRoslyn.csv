Additionally the analyzer driver caches the CFGs for operation block (when first requested by some flow based analyzer) to allow sharing CFGs between flow based analyzers. However we were holding onto these for the entire lifetime of the compilation. This change fixes that by removing the CFG entry once a particular operation block has been fully analyzed.

39394,Re-use semantic model when attempting to compute suppress message att…,"…ribute based suppressions

Current implementation always creates a new semantic model for decoding local suppress message attributes (applied to each symbol). This change attempts to re-use the cached semantic models held by the analyzer driver to avoid rebinding cost.

I'd like to be able to disable this feature: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/visual-csharp-intellisense?view=vs-2019#most-recently-used-members

If I have a type **DateTime** and a variable **dateTime** and I've _most recently_ typed **DateTime** then typing **datet.. ** doesn't autocomplete to **dateTime** but **DateTime**.

Which ends up happening a lot eg:

&gt;var dateTime = DateTime.Now;
&gt;dateT [TAB] =&gt; DateTime.

It's also mentioned here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43922535/autocomplete-case-issue

PLEASE let me turn this off. :)

39369,MonoGlobalAssemblyCache: faster resolves + resolve facade assemblies,"
### Summary

Overall this PR improves assembly resolution in `csi` when running on Mono by resolving facade assemblies like `netstandard.dll`. It also employs a few tricks to reduce resolution time (~4.5x faster according to `Stopwatch` on my machine across 50 iterations before and after).

### Details

1. Don't special case `mscorlib.dll` - we already will have a reference to it and the changes in (2) allow it to still resolve. Remove `GetCorlibPaths`.

2. Have `GetCacAssemblyPaths` bail early if it finds an assembly that lives alongside `mscorlib.dll` or in the `Facades` directory. This These assemblies in Mono are considered ""core"" and will always symlink directly to the GAC. Resolve facade assemblies as well now. The Mono distribution of `csi` has shipped with a response file that explicitly referenced `Facades/netstandard.dll` and `Facades/System.Runtime.dll` and this change obsoletes that. As a consequence local builds of `csi.exe` now work.

3. Minor perf work around converting a public key token to a string by deferring that conversion until only necessary and use `byte.ToString` instead of `StringBuilder.AppendFormat`. Also use a `PooledStringBuilder`.

4. `Tuple` → `ValueTuple`",Area-Compilers|Community,17/10/2019 9:06:05 PM +00:00,,

**Expected Behavior**: Code fix option IDE0047 appears to remove unnecessary parentheses.

**Actual Behavior**: No code fix shown. IDE0047 does appear for the local variable declaration on line 16 so this seems to be an issue specific to switch expressions.",IDE-CodeStyle,17/10/2019 7:12:12 PM +00:00,,allisonchou

---
I am able to reproduce in a new VB.NET console application targetting .NET Framework 4.7.2 and typing the following into the default Module1.vb module - how fast you type varies when exactly the errors show.  This seems to be triggered by `Return Await` since just `Return something` doesn't seem to cause the errors.

```
Module Module1

    Sub Main()

    End Sub

End Module

Class Testing

    Private Async Function WaitForIt() As Task(Of Boolean)
        Return Await tas  '&lt;-- crashes here was starting to type Task.Delay(1000)
    End Function

End Class
```

I first see an exception message at the top:

An exception of type ArgumentException has been encountered.  This may be cause by an extension.

Log file attached for that.  Then several code fix providers crash.

'GenerateParameterizedMemberCodeFixProvider' encountered an error and has been disabled.
'VisualBasicGenerateVariableCodeFixProvider' encountered an error and has been disabled.
'VisualBasicSpellCheckCodeFixProvider' encountered an error and has been disabled.

This method Debug.Asserts so that we know there's an infinite loop bug in the parser in debug mode. In release mode it just returns 'false' so that the related loop terminates and compilation finishes (expected to finish with syntax errors.)

I think we should consider making it so this method also adds a special diagnostic which requests the user to report an issue so that when users inadvertently put the parser into an unexpected no-progress state we can find out about it and address any underlying issues.

39327,C# Rename file to match class name unexpectedly fails to trigger,"_This issue has been moved from [a ticket on Developer Community](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/content/problem/761952/c-rename-file-to-match-class-name-unexpectedly-fai.html)._

I have Ctrl-W mapped to Edit.ExpandSelection.

Prerequisite: Have a class in a .cs file where filename and class name don't match.

Repro actions:
- Place the cursor (using kbd) somewhere in the middle of the class name in the definition of the class.
- Ctrl-W to select the whole class name.
- Engage `EditorContextMenus.CodeWindow.QuickActionsForPosition` (defaultmapped to Ctrl-'.' I believe).

Result: You are not even presented with the choices to rename neither the file nor the class.

Expected: Whether no selection is active or exacly _one_ selection is active where the classname is partially or fully included in a selection together with zero or more leading and/or trailing whitespace the refactoring should be suggested.

From the behavior it seems the bug is the refactoring fails to even understand the cursor is on a class name if a selection is active.

Feel free to replace &quot;class name&quot; with &quot;typename&quot; as it seems likely this bug should affect all kinds of non-predefined typenames.

The tool [queries ](https://github.com/dotnet/buildtools/blob/master/src/Microsoft.DotNet.VersionTools/Automation/GitHubVersionsRepoUpdater.cs#L81)the master branch for latest commits then applies a commit with the new build info.  When this happens multiple times in succession occasionally the query for the latest commits will not return the latest commit.

Example:
In [this build](https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/DevDiv/_build/results?buildId=3143639) we see
```

```

Looking at the master branch log we see a successful [commit ](https://github.com/dotnet/versions/commit/8db4b41f383c084eb31ccd8f0de9da2824107c99) for the first dev16.4 channel publish but no further successful commits.  Looking at the [hash of the failed commit](https://github.com/dotnet/versions/commit/4e2d35b8002d79592594d73903d830f8db1ed632) we see that it's parent is actually `1dc94d9` which is the commit prior to applying the first successful commit.  The parent commit should be the id of the previous commit `8db4b4`

https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/DevDiv/_build/results?buildId=3145509 has a similar failure but it published two successful commits before failing.

39307,Move much of local function data flow to AbstractFlowPass,"Our design for local function flow analysis is now pretty well decided
-- local functions are assumed to preserve state transitions through
calls within the method.

For definite assignment this means that variables which are definitely
assigned inside the local function are assigned on calls to the local
function. This functionality has mostly been moved to AbstractFlowPass.

The remaining functionality namely producing diagnostics based on the
flow state is analysis-specific so I've refactored this to remain in
definite assignment but use stubs that are present in AbstractFlowPass.

This is the first of a few PRs that should eventually address #38548. My plan is:

1. Move a lot of the local function machinery into flow analysis.
2. Add support for non-monotonic transfer functions to local function analysis.
3. Use (1) and (2) to implement nullable analysis over local functions.",Area-Compilers,16/10/2019 12:05:02 AM +00:00,,

39300,Avoid leave.s opcode jumping out of a finally block,"There were two problems with the original implementation:
- within a `try` statement we should only jump to the `finallyEntry` label for disposal when we're inside the `try` or a `catch` block but not if we're inside that `finally` block.
- even with that fixed we were still producing a `leave.s` to jump out of a `finally` which is illegal. So we now jump to the end of the current finally instead.

``` csharp
try
{
}
finally
{
    try
    {
    }
    finally
    {
    }
    // disposal code inserted after finally to jump to next relevant finally should not straight jump to ""exit"" label (invalid leave.s instruction) but instead to the end of the enclosing finally ""finallyExit""

39292,Emit ldloca/ldflda instruction instead of ldloc/ldfld to inspect value types in Expression Evaluation,"**Version Used**: 
All

**Description**:
Currently while debugging Roslyn generates the following IL for locals during expression evaluation (Autos/Local/Watch windows)

Eg.
```
=> $0000: ldloc <index>
    $0001: ret 
```

For value types this ends up creating a copy of the local which has the following issues:

a)	It is expensive since the debugger's IL interpreter does a deep copy of all fields to push it on the stack
b)	In certain cases (such as using visualizers) we want to modify the local. Currently for these cases this is not possible since we are dealing with the returned copy.

The IL generated instead should be:

`ldloc a <index>`
or
`ldflda <field>`
ret

**Steps to Reproduce**:
Inspect a local that is a value type in watch window.",Area-Interactive|Concept-Continuous Improvement,15/10/2019 5:17:04 PM +00:00,,
39291,Non-nullable backing field of property marked uninitialized when property is assigned a value in constructor,"**Version Used**:

**Steps to Reproduce**:

1. Run `dotnet new console` in an empty directory.
2. Enable nullable reference types by specifying `<Nullable>enable</Nullable>` in the `.csproj` file.
3. In `Program.cs` paste in the following code:
```csharp
using System;

namespace ConsoleApp1
{
    internal static class Program
    {
        private static void Main()
        {
            var obj = new MyClass(""Some name"");
            Console.WriteLine(obj.Name);
        }
    }

    public class MyClass
    {
        private string _name;

        public MyClass(string name)
        {
            Name = name;
        }

        public string Name
        {
            get => _name;
            set

                if (value == null)
                    throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(value));
                if (value.Length > 10)

                _name = value;
            }
        }
    }

}
```
3. Run `dotnet build`

**Expected Behavior**:
A build without warnings.

**Actual Behavior**:
The build ends with the following warning:

---
The 'Add parameter' Quick Action can add the wrong parameter in specific situations.
For instance this will happen when an existing parameter accepts a base class of the passed argument type. 
Is this behaviour by design or can this be fixed/improved?

Here is some code sample to reproduce the problem:
```
class BaseClass { }

class MyClass : BaseClass
{
    void TestFunc()
    {
        MyClass param1 = new MyClass();
        int newparam = 1;

// The 'Add parameter' Quick Action on the following method call adds the wrong parameter.
        // It should add an 'int newparam' parameter.
        // But instead it adds a 'MyClass param11' parameter.
        MyFunc(param1 newparam);
    }

void MyFunc(BaseClass param1) { }
}

```

```
Branch master (23 Sep 2019)
Latest commit 89b4f60 by Charles Stoner:
Allow conversion of collection initializer Add extension method this arg (#38732)
```

**Steps to Reproduce**:

Compile the following code:
```cs
#nullable enable
class C
{
    string? field;

    void M1(C c)
    {
        if (c.field == null) return;
        
        c.field.ToString();
    }
    
    void M2(C c)
    {
        if (c is { field: null }) return;
        
        c.field.ToString(); // incorrect CS8602
    }
}
```

**Expected Behavior**:
Both methods report no warnings; If `c.field` is null method returns in both cases before using it.

**Actual Behavior**:
`M2` has an incorrect warning `CS8602: Dereference of a possibly null reference` reported for `c.field.ToString()`

**Notes**
It's actually even worse since such null checks makes Roslyn think that `field` is checked for null but does not update it to non-null on the false branch. Consequently Roslyn reports the warning even if `field` is declared as **non-nullable** `string`
i.e.
```
#nullable enable
class C
{
    string field;
    
    void M2(C c)
    {
        if (c is { field: null }) return;
        
        c.field.ToString(); // incorrect CS8602
    }
}
```

Note that current behavior is quite annoyting since it does not allow me to hande nulls hvia separate patterns in switches e.g.:
```cs
#nullable enable
class C
{
    string? field;
    
    void M2(C c)
    {
        switch (c)
        {
            case { field: null }: break;
            case var copy:
            {
              copy.field.ToString(); // CS8602
              c.field.ToString(); // CS8602
              break;
            }
        }

---
In VS2013 in the VB.NET code window selecting a control from the controls list drop-down would cause the code window to auto-scroll to the handler for that control if that control only had one handler.

This behaviour is no longer present in VS2017 RC - you have to select the event from the events drop-down to make the code window scroll.

I've illustrated the problem in the following video:

https://youtu.be/PhGAI_jw9PY

I've also attached a test case.

As I explain in the video when a control has multiple handlers fair enough - it wouldn't know which section of the code to jump to.  But for buttons there's usually only one and for other controls too - combo boxes for instance often only have a SelectedIndexChanged event.

It would be great to put the auto-scroll behaviour from VS2013 back in - it's a small thing but makes a significant difference over time.

After 90 days of no priority changing activity we’ve closed this report. We prioritize based on severity similar reports and the overall impact on users and scenarios. We've also learned that reports without fresh activity could indicate that the problem isn't a problem anymore. One of our goals is to give you more transparency around these decisions as resolving every problem that gets reported isn't always possible. Closing low priority tickets helps us manage our workload and focus on problems that impact most users. If you still face this issue in our latest version please report it as a new problem.

Write this code:

}

class Derived : Base { }
```

**Expected Behavior**:

I would expect this code to fail to compile. `Base` doesn't have a default constructor so `Derived` should be required to explicitly call a base constructor. The fact that the base class constructor has an optional parameter shouldn't change that.

The code compiles. The compiler implicitly emits a call to `base(0)`:

39248,Tests in PerformanceTrackerServiceTests fail when the current English language culture uses a different number format,"When running the included tests on my Windows 10 machine which has its display language set to English (United States) and its regional settings set to English (Sweden) (en-SE) four of the five tests in the `PerformanceTrackerServiceTests` class fail with the message ""System.InvalidOperationException : Sequence contains no elements"".

Digging a bit deeper shows that the cause of the exception is a section of code in the `PerformanceTrackerServiceTests.CreateMatrix()` method which tries to parse numeric values like `7.0` as doubles and fails to do so because the en-SE culture has its decimal separator set to a comma and not a period.

The format provider used to parse the numbers is resolved via `EnsureEnglishUICulture.PreferredOrNull` which returns null if `CultureInfo.CurrentUICulture.Name` starts with ""en"" and `CultureInfo.InvariantCulture` otherwise. The intention seems to be to always try to fall back to the current culture if it appears to be a common English language culture like en-US or en-UK that have a lot of formatting settings in common but this doesn't always work when the current culture is en-SE or some other less common culture.

I have fixed this issue locally by simply forcing the use of `CultureInfo.InvariantCulture` when parsing the numeric values in these particular tests but I think it could also be worth looking into `EnsureEnglishUICulture.PreferredOrNull` and maybe restricting it to a strict subset of English language cultures that are known to work.

39243,'Generate Equals' does not annotate Equals(T) to allow nulls and causes CS8604,"**Version Used**: 16.4p1

In .NET Core 3.0 `IEquatable.Equals` is annotated to accept a nullable parameter:

```cs
    public interface IEquatable<T>
    {
        bool Equals([AllowNull] T other);
    }
```

https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/blob/v3.0.0/src/System.Private.CoreLib/shared/System/IEquatable.cs#L11

But on earlier versions of .NET Core on .NET Standard and on .NET Framework in a project where NRTs are enabled `IEquatable<>.Equals` does not have this attribute. The generated code in this situation is overly restrictive (**actual**):

```cs
#nullable enable

class Foo : IEquatable<Foo>
{
    public int Bar { get; }

    public override bool Equals(object? obj)
    {
        // CS8604 Possible null reference argument for parameter 'other' in 'bool Foo.Equals(
        // Foo other)'.
        //            ↓
        return Equals(obj as Foo);
    }

    public bool Equals(Foo other)
    {
        return other != null &&
               Bar == other.Bar;
    }
}
```

This code should be generated for all targets:

```cs
#nullable enable

class Foo : IEquatable<Foo>
{
    public int Bar { get; }

    public override bool Equals(object? obj)
    {
        return Equals(obj as Foo);
    }

    public bool Equals(Foo? other)
    {
        return other != null &&
               Bar == other.Bar;

In any situation where `==` is *already* being generated as the most preferable option for a value type I believe `==` would be the most preferable option for the nullable version of that value type:

Actual:

```cs
class Foo
{
    public decimal A { get; }
    public decimal? B { get; }

    public override bool Equals(object? obj)
    {
        return obj is Foo foo &&
               A == foo.A &&
               EqualityComparer<decimal?>.Default.Equals(B foo.B);
    }
}
```

Expected:

```cs
class Foo
{
    public decimal A { get; }
    public decimal? B { get; }

    public override bool Equals(object? obj)
    {
        return obj is Foo foo &&
               A == foo.A &&

Branch master (23 Sep 2019)
Latest commit 89b4f60 by Charles Stoner:
Allow conversion of collection initializer Add extension method this arg (#38732)
```

**Steps to Reproduce**:

Compile and run the following code:
```cs
#nullable enable
class C<T>
{
  public C(T t) => Property = t;
  public T Property { get; }
}

class Program
{
  static void Main()

    s = null;
    goto hell;
  }

}
```

**Expected Behavior**:
`warning CS8602: Dereference of a possibly null reference.` reported for `prop.ToString()`

**Actual Behavior**:
No warnings are reported for the program above. The program crashes at runtime with a `NullReferenceException`

**Notes**
If you specify the type of `c` explicitly i.e. `C<string?> c = GetC(s);` you'll get the correct warning.",3 - Working|Area-Compilers|Bug|New Language Feature - Nullable Reference Types,10/10/2019 7:19:18 PM +00:00,,gafter

---
```
class RFE_SimplifyInit
{
  struct S { public int a b; }

    rg[0] = 1;
    rg[1] = 2;
  }
}
```
Working example:
- Place cursor on line `S s =`.
- Invoke QuickActions.

Result: You get the option `Object initialization can be simplified` and when executed you get the expected
```
S s = new S
{
  a = 1
  b = 2
};
```

RFE:
- Place cursor on line `int[] rg =`.
- Invoke QuickActions.

Result: No option to simplify.

Expected: Option to simplify with result
```
int[] rg = new int[2]
{
  1
  2
};
```

Considerations expected limitations:
For implementation simplicity and to retain sematical correctness and sequence points in case init expressions are more complex only consider the refactoring when array-elements assignments index-order is both sequential and starting from zero.

39210,error CS0029: Cannot implicitly convert type 'STCADPro.Model.SCFrequency [STCADPro.Model Version=1.0.0.0 Culture=neutral PublicKeyToken=null]' to 'STCADPro.Model.SCFrequency',"Hi

When running script using **CodeAnalysis**  I receive an exception saying I cannot convert to a type but **the types are exactly the same!**   Please help! I'm stuck on this for a few days.

The code is something like:
```
var mscorlib = typeof(System.Object).Assembly;
var systemCore = typeof(System.Linq.Enumerable).Assembly;
var stcad = typeof(SCProjects).Assembly;
scriptOptions = ScriptOptions.Default.AddReferences(mscorlib systemCore stcad);
scriptOptions = scriptOptions.AddImports(""System"" ""System.IO"" ""System.Threading.Tasks"" ""System.Linq""""STCADPro.Model"" ""STCADPro.Physics"");

var state_ = CSharpScript.RunAsync(@"""" scriptOptions).Result;
state_ = state_.ContinueWithAsync(""SCFrequency P3 = new SCFrequency();"" scriptOptions).Result;
state_ = state_.ContinueWithAsync(""SCFrequency P4 = P3; "" scriptOptions).Result;
````

That's basically initializing the script engine running first code (RunAsync) and then using the previous result as new state using ContinueWithAsync.  I think this is classic schema. I would put this into a loop as this has to be an interpreter (command line) a  REPL.

I added the assembly STCAD Pro using typeof(SCProjects).Assembly  SCProjects is a class of that assembly. 

The problem comes in the last line with: SCFrequency P4 = P3   the system does not understand P4 is the same type as P3.   
Interestingly if I parse all the code at once it works. So I have the impression that between calls some reference to the assembly are lost and perhaps duplicated and even it's the same assembly (and DLL file) it complains.

**Version Used**: 
CodeAnalysis:
2.4 but I tried also
3.4.0-beta1-final (latest available)

Visual Studio 2019 Community. 16.3.3.

**Steps to Reproduce**:

1.   Run the code above. It requires the STCAD Model library I'm sorry I can't deliver this library. But I think is not related to the library but any other external library may have the same problem.
2.  Last line of script (SCFrequency P3 = P4;)  shall be executed without problem.  
3.  However there is an exception thrown see below.

In this example the class used is SCFrequency but I tried with other classes in the assembly STCAD Pro Model  and the problem also exists.

STCAD Pro Model is a Project which is in the same solution! It is added as a project reference and its DLL copied to the output folder. Except for this issue everything works well in this app.

Just started using C#.  None of the auto formatting works as does in VB.  For example braces aren't indented.  None of the code is properly indented either after typing.  All &quot;Auto Format&quot; options are on under Tools.... Options.... Text Editor... C#... Code Style... Formatting.  There is also no EditorConfig file.  This happens on all projects.   VB properly auto formats.  See attachments for screenshots. Visual Studio Enterprise 2019 Version 16.3.0. I did search various forums but could not find any information.

First of all I have a switch expression that returns instances of classes that all have a common superclass so I would expect the switch expression to return the common superclass type instead of having a &quot;no best type found&quot; error.

Secondly if I manually specify the type of the variable to put the result of the switch expression in I get the IDE0007 suggestion.  If I follow the suggestion I'm back at the &quot;no best type found&quot; error.

Open the file.

End
Ctrl-M CTRL-M (to unfold the class).
Move to beginning of line say 449 (i.e. fn87).
Shift-Down once to select.
Alt-Up a few times. Notice how the view (in error) scrolls upwards.
Now try either Alt-Down or even Undo (Ctrl-Z). The view _continues_ to scroll upwards!

Expected: I shouldn't have to write this but... the view should obviously not scroll like this unless it's required to keep selection/caret visible.

Formatting a section or document which contains labels can result in inconsistant indentation of labels. If a label followed a non-bracketed if statement the label will be indented further than if it follows a a bracketed if statement

        {

    Cleanup:
        // Do Cleanup
        return;
    }
```

Sample 2:

If you debug this test and set a breakpoint in Symbol.DeclaringCompilation it will get hit on a LocalFunctionSymbol whose ContainingModule is a PEModuleSymbol. This results in the method returning a `null` DeclaringCompilation even though the symbol is in source.

I can't tell if this is by design or if it is a bug. But it results in a NRE when I try to make use of the DeclaringCompilation on a symbol--when that symbol also has a binder with a non-null Compilation on it.

39159,Infer indentation in files with IIndentationManagerService,"IIndentationManagerService is a new service from the editor that looks at the existing tabs and spaces in a file and attempts to determine what the prevailing format is. This is useful for repositories that may have not had an .editorconfig to specify what is happening or for repositories that have such a mix that an .editorconfig may not be immediately useful.

Commit-at-a-time review is **very strongly recommended** because this PR mixes both feature implementation and also refactoring a bunch of test helpers.

39158,Using cref to itself inside inheritdoc crashes VS,"_This issue has been moved from [a ticket on Developer Community](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/content/problem/761030/using-cref-to-itself-inside-inheritdoc-crashes-vs.html)._

---
This is a new issue as inheritdoc is just being added in 16.4.0 preview 1. This problem therefor only happens in 16.4.0 preview 1 (or later?). 

With the new feature we can use /// &lt;inheritdoc/&gt; to define the same xml comments from the inheritted class on members that are inherited. /// &lt;inheritdoc/&gt; works fine but /// &lt;inheritdoc cref=&quot;MyProperty&quot; /&gt; crashes Visual Studio to desktop ('CTD') upon hovering the mouse over MyProperty. 

To recreate:

1. Create a new .NET Core Console App.
2. Create a new interface: IMyClass with a member (can be property method ...) MyMember and add a summary to it with ///.
3. Create a new class: MyClass that implements IMyClass (add &quot;: IMyClass&quot;).
4. Implement the member MyMember. 
5. Add /// &lt;inheritdoc /&gt; above MyMember. So far so good.
6. Change &lt;inheritdoc /&gt; to &lt;inheritdoc cref=&quot;MyMember&quot;/&gt; and move your mouse over MyMember. VS will crash before it can show the tooltip.

39155,Inconsist diagnostics on extension GetAwaiter,"After invesgating #25861 I've found that using `await` when missing `GetAwaiter()` *extension* method can results in 3 different error codes:
- **CS1061** No such instance or extension member
```csharp
    public class Foo
    {
        async void M(Foo foo)
        {
            await foo;
        }
    }
```
- **CS4036** Specialised  for WinRT async interfaces
```csharp
    public class Foo
    {
        async void M(Windows.Foundation.IAsyncAction ia)
        {
            await ia;
        }
    }
```
- **CS1929** Extension method overload resolution fail
```csharp
using System;
using System.Runtime.CompilerServices;

namespace A
{
    public class Foo
    {
        async void M(Foo foo)
        {

        public bool IsCompleted { get; }
        public void OnCompleted(Action continuation) {}
        public void GetResult() {}
    }
}

```

Currently add imports service can only recognize the first case **CS1061**.
Linq syntax provides a specialised **CS1929** and the general **CS1936**.
However missing method for deconstruction provides one consist error code **CS8129**:
```csharp
using System;
using System.Runtime.CompilerServices;

namespace A
{
    public class Foo
    {
        async void M(Foo foo)
        {
            var (a b) = foo;
        }
    }

    public static class BarExtension
    {
        // Reports CS8129 no matter existence of this method
        public static void Deconstruct(this string foo out int a out int b)
        {
            a = 1;
            b = 2;
        }
    }
}

namespace A.Extension
{
    public static class FooExtensions

            a = 1;
            b = 2;
        }
    }

This makes code fix much easier to deal with it.

<p></p><p>Hi there. This is just a suggestion to the Community and a request to engage with the Microsoft Development </p><p>Community. I am very keen to have your comments on this suggestion please. </p><p>My suggestion is to have a directive or tag along the lines of #region in C# in Visual Studio that groups sections of a class' public interface. </p> <p>Hence this could then be viewed in Intellisense when writing code. </p> <p>For example if you have a Car class that has different Drive functions </p><p>eg DriveFast DriveSlow DriveMedium and other public functions aswell. You could group the Drive functions under the Drive tag. Then in Intellisense in Visual Studio you </p><p>could drill down for example if you had a car variable aCar.</p> <p>It would appear in Inteliisense as acar. Drive.DriveSlow and when you selected the function </p><p>it would appear in code as acar. DriveSlow. </p><p>This could be optional with functions appearing under their categories in Intellisense if they were tagged </p><p>or not if they weren't. </p> <p>So this would be a view of a class' public functions rather like a View of a database. </p> <p>This could help in documentation understanding and writing code in Visual Studio and maybe lessen </p><p>the need to have Interfaces.</p>

Often using DI we have things like

public MyClass(IFirstInterface firstInterface ISecondInterface secondInterface)
{
    _firstInterface = firstInterface;
    _secondInterface = secondInterface;
}

Currently if i rename IFirstInterface -&gt; ISomethingElse it only renames the interface not the fields variables and parameters.

public MyClass(ISomethingElse firstInterface ISecondInterface secondInterface)
{
    _firstInterface = firstInterface;
    _secondInterface = secondInterface;
}

Really it should go further and do the same as Resharper:

public MyClass(ISomethingElse somethingElse ISecondInterface secondInterface)
{
    _somethingElse= somethingElse;
    _secondInterface = secondInterface;
}

This is factually incorrect. While the warning on the obsolete element is sensible adding obsolete to the method would mark this method as obsolete - which is wrong. It may need rework but it is not obsolete - it is still to be used.

This would be different if the obsolete element would be part of input or output parameters. But in this case it is not - it is defined within the method body and then discarded.",Area-IDE|Resolution-By Design,8/10/2019 12:28:49 PM +00:00,15/10/2019 7:19:00 PM +00:00,

39117,Refactor object from different directives,"_This issue has been moved from [a ticket on Developer Community](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/content/idea/741362/refactor-object-from-different-directives.html)._

---
can we do refactoring of same object name from different setup in directives especially if the object inside #if(DEBUG) ?

```
#if (DEBUG)
	public static ConnectionString CurrentConnectionString = new ConnectionString(&quot;DEVELOPEMENTsqlserver&quot;&quot;db&quot;&quot;mgmguardiana&quot;&quot;password&quot;false);
#else
        public static ConnectionString CurrentConnectionString = new ConnectionString(&quot;PRODUCTIONsqlserver&quot;&quot;db&quot;&quot;mgmguardiana&quot;&quot;password&quot;false);;
#endif
    }
```

In this example if I use ctrl+R+R in `CurrentConnectionString` assume that I'm in debug mode any reference will be updated only under the current directive(DEBUG) and when switching to release mode the codes may go broke and need to rename it again.

Current steps of refactoring
1. From screenshot in example at DEBUG mode press CTRL+R+R to show rename the object of `CurrentConnectionString` into `RenamedConnection` and press ENTER
2. Run or build in debug mode no errors will be raise.
3. Now switch to release assume that you are now ready to deploy the application
4. Run or build in release mode errors will be made that all references of `RenamedConnection` are invalid
5. Refactor the `CurrentConnectionString` into `RenamedConnection` while still in release mode.
6. Run or build to test

---
I love the refactoring features of Visual Studio but I have seen multiple scenarios where it suggests adding unnecessary casts in order to do another refactoring. My most recent one being converting to a conditional expression. Here is the code before refactoring the refactored code and what I believe the code should be refactored to:

```
'Before Refactoring:
If useparallel Then : Me.itmNames.ItemsSource = Me.Players.AsParallel(). AsOrdered(). Select(Function(pd index) New With {. Name = pd. Name . Index = index . ColumnWidth = Me.GetScoreColumnWidth(index)})
Else : Me.itmNames.ItemsSource = Me.Players.Select(Function(pd index) New With {. Name = pd. Name . Index = index . ColumnWidth = Me.GetScoreColumnWidth(index)})
End If

'Refactored By Visual Studio 2019:
Me.itmNames.ItemsSource = If(useparallel
	Me.Players.AsParallel(). AsOrdered(). Select(Function(pd index) New With {. Name = pd. Name . Index = index . ColumnWidth = Me.GetScoreColumnWidth(index)})
	DirectCast(Me.Players.Select(Function(pd index) New With {. Name = pd. Name . Index = index . ColumnWidth = Me.GetScoreColumnWidth(index)}) Object))

'Refactored By Me (notice that I do not include the unnecessary DirectCast):
Me.itmNames.ItemsSource = If(useparallel
	Me.Players.AsParallel(). AsOrdered(). Select(Function(pd index) New With {. Name = pd. Name . Index = index . ColumnWidth = Me.GetScoreColumnWidth(index)})
	Me.Players.Select(Function(pd index) New With {. Name = pd. Name . Index = index . ColumnWidth = Me.GetScoreColumnWidth(index)}))
```
This is of course not hard to change but neither are things like removing unnecessary parentheses and some other refactorings. I just thought I would mention this as a refactoring improvement since it adds an extra method (as opposed to just making the code look prettier but still the same after being compiled).

---
Support for [local functions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/local-functions) was added in C# 7.0 which is awesome.  However decorating a local function with `&lt;summary&gt;...&lt;/summary&gt; ` tags will not produce any Intellisense in Visual Studio 2019 (as of version 16.2.5):
```
private static string GetText(string path string filename)
{
    /// &lt;summary&gt;
    /// Append a path separator character to the specified file path.
    /// &lt;/summary&gt;
    string AppendPathSeparator(string filepath)
    {
        if (!filepath. EndsWith(@&quot;\&quot;))
           filepath += @&quot;\&quot;;

return filepath;   
    }

// No Intellisense for the &quot;AppendPathSeparator&quot; local function will appear here.
    var sr = File.OpenText(AppendPathSeparator(path) + filename);
    var text = sr. ReadToEnd();
    return text;
} 
```

It would be great to have some way of producing Intellisense for local functions.

39098,Build system feedback,"As a first-time builder of any Roslyn code I thought it could be interesting for you doing this on a daily basis to get some input from someone that tested it out for the first time.


Documentation:
- The instructions for kicking off ""your first build"" is Good Stuff. Short and concise; Four short bullet points. Very good. Gold Star.

- The ""-help"" switch to eng/build.ps1 should probably be mentioned on the build instructions page. I only found out about it (and other including vital options) by inspecting first the cmd files and then that ps-script itself.

- Disk space requirements could be specified on the Building wiki page. Probably updated on a schedule (every month or so?) and last date measured added to the documentation. Both for no-argument (i.e. Debug) builds and Release builds. At least a ballpark figure would be nice to have. It would have saved me a ton of wasted time and effort. I created a ten GiB VHD and thought  ""This surely must be at least four times of what's required but let's make it this extremely large to be really really sure"" - how wrong I was... but more on that later.


Flexibility/options:
- I'm missing an option to disable creation of any and all tests.

- I'm missing an option to disable creation of all the locale directories. To put it mildly I am more than a little annoyed of all the thousands of locale directories VS itself spews all over the installation laying waste to both precious disk space and adding filesystem fragmentation something fiercely. I had hoped I wouldn't have to see that repeated in the bin/* output curtesy of a switch or two.

- Please consider using filesystem links for immutable files where available. Even NTFS has had hardlinks since the 90's. It's not instilling confidence to see gigabyte after gigabyte of redundant copies of the same files in umpteen places. So far into the build process there are f.ex. fourty (40!) copies of Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Test.Resources.Proprietary.dll racking up almost 4 GiB. The build has stalled so I don't know how many more redundant copies will be created. That's just the most prominent one. I'm sure there are plenty more.

- Ability to build a single DLL. If that's impossible due to limitations in _&lt;something&gt;_ at least building a single ""package"" of sorts. Maybe it's possible by going deeper than using Build.cmd? If so some documentation pointing to the procedure from the short and sweet build instructions could be good.

In my case I knew exactly what I needed to get VS stop crashing. I needed to fix one single bug and build a replacement for one single file Microsoft.VisualStudio.LanguageServices.dll. Instead of being able to build just that DLL (from what I have found at least) I'm now continually fighting with disk-space running out running `compact /c /f /s /exe:lzx artifacts\*` like a madman from a separate shell while periodically Suspending all the build processes from the Resource Monitor trying to keep up with the torrent of other stuff it's filling up the volume with - stuff I really  don't want produced. Yeah it's partially a problem with me not allocating enough disk space but I couldn't in my wildest imagination think I'd need over ten gigabyte to build a single DLL that's just a hair over 1.5 MB. That points back to the need for some documented info of how much disk space should be expected to be consumed.

- Many many warnings about SourceLink ""Source control information is not available"". It seems a bit strange considering it's a pristine git clone and `git` is indeed available in the path. Granted it's better than `roslyn-analyzers` where the same yapping produces build _errors_ instead (though that used a _slightly_ different but still like `roslyn`itself a beta version) but it's still not good and is not adding confidence.

Besides these issues it seems the build system works pretty well. It could use some work to beat it into better shape but overall it seems quite straightforward.

Thumbs up.

39092,VisualStudioUnresolvedAnalyzerReference not overriding Display property provokes VS 16.3 crash.,"Regression from what shipped with VS 16.2.

Crash. Unhandled .NET exception.

Sure it's VS acting up (and perhaps especially bad it's not handling this exception) but it seems this code is not doing what it `Should` (to quote)

A quick (and dirty?) ""fix"" could be to just add an override for that property forwarding to `_underlying.Display` since that seems to have a non-null string but I also believe this code needs a bit more unit testing the baseclass comment ""should"" could benefit from some clarification (is it supposed to be dependable non-null or is it an optional suggestion) and

@mavasani  that FxCop code needs to be fixed to not blindly trust reference values.

Since this is currently a show-stopper for us (we're at an effective stand still not able to trust VS to not crash while editing code) perhaps that could be incentive to fast track a fix?

Edit: Just in case it helps understanding the issue `_underlying.Display` contains the string

39090,"Handling of non-nullable fields for classes with ""Init"" method","I have a bunch of related classes that are constructed in 2 steps:
1) Object is instantiated constructor is called
2) Init() method is called

The problem is that some fields are initialized in Init() method and are guaranteed to be non-null afterwards. However the compiler complains that these fields are not initialized so I'm forced to either mark them as nullable (which I don't like) or do some tricks like explicitly initializing them with null! in the constructor to silence the compiler.
Have you considered allowing to annotate certain methods as ""init methods""? The effect would be that non-null fields/properties would have to be initialized either in the constructor or in init method(s).
In cases when Init is in fact part of the object construction no other method should be called in between (maybe apart from setting some properties). This means it's usually safe to leave such fields/properties as not-null and once Init method is called it's safe to access them.",Area-Compilers|Feature Request|New Language Feature - Nullable Reference Types,6/10/2019 5:52:53 PM +00:00,,

Below are a few of the language specification's assertions.  If there is a mismatch we will have to decide whether we want to change the compiler or the specification.

> Case is unimportant in Visual Basic programs. For simplicity all terminals will be given in standard casing but any casing will match them. Terminals that are printable elements of the ASCII character set are represented by their corresponding ASCII characters. Visual Basic is also width insensitive when matching terminals allowing full-width Unicode characters to match their half-width Unicode equivalents but only on a whole-token basis. A token will not match if it contains mixed half-width and full-width characters.

See also https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halfwidth_and_Fullwidth_Forms_(Unicode_block)

> Identifiers are case insensitive so two identifiers are considered to be the same identifier if they differ only in case. 
> Note   The Unicode Standard one-to-one case mappings are used when comparing identifiers and any locale-specific case mappings are ignored.

> It may be possible in other languages to create a declaration space that contains different kinds of entities with the same name (for example if the language is case sensitive and allows different declarations based on casing). In that situation the most accessible entity is considered bound to that name; if more than one type of entity is most accessible then the name is ambiguous. Public is more accessible than Protected Friend Protected Friend is more accessible than Protected or Friend and Protected or Friend is more accessible than Private.

39086,Prevent removing all whitespace when formatting unrecognized whitespace charactes,"Fixes https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/38895.

Also used C# tuple instead of `ValueTuple` as the return type of a related method.

---

As I understand it the issue here is that:

1. Spacing formatting is suppressed within multiline collection initializers:

    https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/e8a7d91cc01b8904a876b362598a468337c169e7/src/Workspaces/CSharp/Portable/Formatting/Rules/SuppressFormattingRule.cs#L391-L396

2. When formatting is suppressed whitespace-only trivia is still normalized to remove unknown whitespace characters:

    https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/e8a7d91cc01b8904a876b362598a468337c169e7/src/Workspaces/CSharp/Portable/Formatting/Engine/Trivia/TriviaDataFactory.cs#L151-L154

But when unknown whitespace characters are the only whitespace characters this leads to zero whitespace between the two tokens and thus often to invalid code. This PR fixes that by replacing the unknown whitespace with a single space.

The result should be valid code but likely one with weird whitespace formatting (see the unit test where the `new C()` line has no indentation after formatting). I think it would be nice if formatting wasn't suppressed for multiline collection initializes but I don't understand the reasons behind that and so I think it's outside the scope of this PR.",Area-IDE|Community,5/10/2019 6:25:29 PM +00:00,,sharwell

On one hand the Roslyn repository does not supporting being used with line endings other than CRLF on Windows. Our tests and infrastructure depend on that. If you use anything other than CRLF there will be problems running tests.

39063,Fixed incorrect IDE0044 (Make field readonly) when the field is accessed by refeference.,"In OperationExtensions there is an extension method **GetValueUsageInfo** which should return whether a given operation performs any read write etc.

The **MakeFieldReadonlyDiagnosticAnalyzer** class uses this information to infer whether a field can be made readonly. GetValueUsageInfo doesn't perform any analysis when the operation's parent is variable initializer and in that case it always returns **ValueUsageInfo.Read** which causes the diagnostic analyzer to wrongly suggest to make a field readonly.

Here is example where it fails:

``` csharp
class Program
{
    int i;

    void M()
    {
        ref var value = ref i;
        value += 1;
    }
}
```
 I've added a case inside GetValueUsageInfo to correctly handle this situation and also introduced 2 new unit tests to verify it is working. I am unsure however if somewhere there isn't something that depends on the method returning incorrectly ValueUsageInfo.Read for such cases.

Fixes #38995.",Area-IDE|Community,4/10/2019 4:05:14 PM +00:00,15/10/2019 6:40:19 PM +00:00,mavasani

1. Support Go to base in case with bases is in metadata.
2. Removes interfaces implemented by hidden by new/Shadows members from the base hierarchy if the interface is not implemented below the hide. For example:
```
interface I { void M(); }
class C : I { public virtual void M(); }
class D : C { public new void M(); }
```
here 
```
I i = new D();
i.M(); 
```
calls `C.M()` not `D.M()`. Therefore `I.M()` is not a base for `D.M()`. Fixed this.
3. Fixed a issue with overloads and interfaces.",Area-IDE,4/10/2019 1:07:20 AM +00:00,10/10/2019 10:03:44 PM +00:00,

---
Actual result:
If you (f.ex) rename a field in a class by hitting CTRL+R CTRL+R then possibly type a name containing a trailing space or if you just paste a name from clipboard containing a trailing space the rename refactoring not only treats this as if the new identifier is to _have_  a space at the end it adds that space _everywhere_ the identifier is used and obviously also where it's defined.

Expected:
Strip any and all non-valid leading and trailing control characters. Hell just abort the operation for all I care but not this.

&quot;Split string literals on enter&quot; has been broken since it was introduced and still is in VS2019.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1408396/66427836-a5bf8080-e9c9-11e9-94bd-98508de86053.png)

Additionally it's _completely_ broken if you use multi-carets. Then it doesn't even pretent to attempt to &quot;Split string literals on enter&quot; it just splits and indents each caret without inserting quotes totally destroying the string literal.

I can be more forgiving about the latter bug since multi-caret was a later addition to the editor &lt;rant_mode=&quot;on&quot;&gt;but please - stuff like this needs to be _checked_ before release&lt;rant_mode=&quot;off&quot;&quot;&gt;.
Anyway it's a clear bug and needs to be fixed. Should be no more than a few minutes of work after the main bug has been fixed.

39034,Pool analyzer diagnostic reporters,"This has shown up as a significant source of allocations. The design
here is that when an analyzer reports a diagnostic we may need to filter
or alter it based on some configuration. Previously we stored the
configuration information by closing over captured variables but that
could be very expensive if it's being done for every analyzer
invocation. Since we can only really execute one analyzer per running
thread on the machine the actual number of concurrent objects we need
to create is approximately the number of running threads. Pooling is a
good solution to this problem.

38994,Attribute async state machines for better introspection,"Hi

I've recently written a PoC of an async builder that allows you to suspend the thread of execution to disk and rehydrate at a later point or even on a different machine. It appears to work ok (as long as the captures are serializable obviously) but writing the code to demangle the state machine fields was tricky and I'm pretty sure it's not right now. I've attached the code but it would be really nice if the state machine builder put some attributes on the fields so we can inspect them. E.g. 

[StateMachineState] on the integer state field
[StateMachineInput(""i"")] for the method arguments
[StateMachineLocal(""j"")] for captured locals
[StateMachineAwaiter(index)] or similar for the awaiters

I don't think it needs a lot more. Having exposed the state machine builders I'm not sure the internals of state machines could be changed easily so I don't think this is adding much of a backwards compatibility issue.

On a side note is it possible to remove the debug bypass on the statemachines to see what's happening under the cover more easily?

Thanks
Ben Young

38992,Add regex header support for configuring severity and IDE code style options with .editorconfig,"This PR builds off #35691 by fixing a few bugs mostly involving regex. It also changes which .editorconfig headers are generated for new rules based on the rule type and diagnostic file type.

The following are a few changes in the PR:

**1) Adds regex support for configuring severity level and IDE code style options from the editor** 
Previously hard-coded and the majority of regex headers were not supported when configuring severity level and/or code options from the editor. Below is an example screenshot of the existing functionality with an .editorconfig file and program titled Program.cs:
![5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16968319/66009806-f63a5980-e470-11e9-8c7d-02eca4c69545.png)
![1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16968319/66006617-19aad780-e464-11e9-9834-b2696942c05b.png)
And the below is the updated functionality which should work for any regex header:
![3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16968319/66007080-bcb02100-e465-11e9-8d5a-239b8c0028b4.png)

**2) Deals with duplicate rules**
Previously if a user specified a rule multiple times in an .editorconfig file with valid headers then only the first rule would be changed when configuring the severity level and/or code style options from the editor. Now only the last rule is changed in accordance with how duplicate rules are actually dealt with in an .editorconfig file.

**3) Verify first header in .editorconfig file is valid**
Previously the first header in the file was always deemed to be valid no matter the name or file extension(s). The current change verifies that the first header in the .editorconfig file matches the name of the diagnostic file.

**4) Changes how new headers and existing rules are generated/configured**

_**Configuring existing rules:**_ We configure an existing rule in an .editorconfig file if its header contains the diagnostic file's extension.
For example when working with a C# file [\*] [\*.cs] [\*.{csvb}] would all be considered valid headers when configuring existing rules. Previously for C# files only [\*.cs] was recognized when configuring rules from the editor.

_**Generating new rules and headers:**_ If a rule is not present in the .editorconfig file under a valid header then we generate it while taking into consideration whether the IsPerLanguage flag is set and whether the diagnostic is a compiler diagnostic.

First we search for existing valid headers:
1) If the diagnostic's isPerLanguage = true it means the rule is valid for both C# and VB. Thus if there is a valid existing header containing both [\*.cs] and [\*.vb] then we prioritize it.
2) If isPerLanguage = false or we are dealing with a compiler diagnostic it means the rule is only valid for one of the languages. Thus we prioritize headers that contain only the file extension for the given language. 
3) If neither of the above hold true we choose the last existing valid header. 
4) If no valid existing headers we generate a new header.

When generating a new header:
1) If PerLanguage = true we generate [*.{csvb}].
2) If PerLanguage = false or we have a compiler diagnostic we generate [\*cs] or [\*.vb] depending on the header.",Area-IDE,2/10/2019 12:27:24 AM +00:00,7/10/2019 6:13:13 PM +00:00,

VS16.4Preview1

<del>Not sure but I remember that doesn't happen with latest preview version of VS16.3. It not happen with `Preview Features`/`Allow partial loading of projects during solution open` disabled.</del>
It's strange that I can also see the same thing happen on VS16.3.1 today or with `partial loading` disabled today. Just step 4 and 5 or 4.B is needed.

Not sure it's an issue of roslyn or VS.

**Steps to Reproduce**:

1. Enable `Preview Features`/`Allow partial loading of projects during solution open` in VS16.4Preview1 and restart.
2. Open the attached solutions(All cs files are removed. I tried to rename the projects and folders but failed)
[Solution.zip](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/files/3665454/Solution.zip)

3. Wait and see whether the task `Loading Intellsense` can finish or not.(sometimes it even failed at the first time)

4. If it finished click `File/Close Solutions` and reopen the solution again.
5. Wait and see the task `Loading Intellsense` never finish.

4.B Maybe you can also see the same thing when you edit `Server.Core.csproj` online(inside VS with the whole solution open) just needed to change the `TargetFrameworks` from `net472;netcoreapp3.0` to `net472;netcoreapp2.1` or revert.

Intellsense should always end.

38935,Simplify parsing of attributes,"I recommend reviewing this with whitespace changes *off*.

Our existing parsing strategy was pretty strange given that we would create a mutable builder fill it with parsed attributes then pass that builder along.  This was confusing and potentially error prone as no downstream consumers were ever expected to continue mutating the list.  It also meant in several places we needed more complex try/finally logic to place things back in the pool.

I've moved to an approach where we just parse out hte attribute list on demand and then pass along to whoever wants to consume it.

~Note: i would like to do this next with modifiers.  Though i am *less* certain if that will be possible due to downstream consumers possibly wanting to mutate hte modifiers list after the initial parsing.~

Update: modifiers looks to be much harder/out-of-scope.  The mods list is definitely mutated post creation making it less suitable for this sort of up-front realization of the list.",Area-Compilers|Community,27/09/2019 11:32:57 PM +00:00,30/09/2019 8:48:47 PM +00:00,jcouv

There are a number of rules and tools to help the developer. One of these is being able to add a missing USING reference. Another is enforcing rules about where a USING statement should appear in a code file. PLEASE make it so the two understand each other. It's really annoying to have an automatically added 'anything' immediatley become a problem.

Often I want to share a class or a function or a member etc with another team member  and browsing in VS I can easily copy a name like &quot;Foo&quot; and send it to them but that is ambiguous for them to find in a very large codebase.

Instead I'd like to send them the fully qualified namespace &quot;Team::Project::Component::Foo&quot;
I find myself doing this a lot the hard way by hovering over the object to see it's intellisense info and typing tha tout manually which is error prone and tedious.

Editor team has requested that we share the name on our semantic classification view tagger and bugger tagger providers. This allows them to implement the following strategy to avoid creating both taggers where possible:

1. Create the view taggers first.
2. Keep track of the names of the view tagger providers that created a tagger for a particular buffer.
3. Don’t call buffer tagger providers for a buffer if it has the same name as a view tagger provider that provided a tagger for that buffer.

This also requires that the returned tagger returns tags when either GetTags() or GetAllTags() is called.",Area-IDE,27/09/2019 8:43:44 PM +00:00,,

Following code:

{ }

private static unsafe void Bar()

    Foo<int?>();
}
```

[Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/unmanaged-types) states: ""Any user-defined struct type that contains fields of unmanaged types..."". Don't know why it talks only about ""user-defined"" structs (maybe because of ```Span<T>```?) but I don't know about any reason for disallowing nullable types. They are just structs with two fields (```bool``` and ```T```). So when ```T``` is unmanaged than ```T?``` is unmanaged too.

I'm really depressed of this. I've expected constructed unmanaged types would have worked already in C# 7.3. Now I hoped it would be supported by 8.0 because of explicit addition of support for constructed unmanaged types but it's still not usable enough.
Now I'm workarounding this issue by using ```Unsafe``` class and using runtime checks for checking that ```T``` is unmanaged/blittable (allowing nullable types). It would be nice to have compile time support for this.

Roslyn relies on file system watches to detect changes in the source files. Events from the watcher may be handled by Roslyn at any point in time after the debugging started or not at all since the OS does not guarantee the events to be triggered.

The PR adds a source file content checksum validation before the EnC service starts computation that depends on the content of a document at the start of the debug session. The validation compares the checksum stored in the PDB by the compiler with the current content of the file on disk. Documents are considered out-of-sync until the EnC service observes file content with matching checksum.

38900,[IDE0069] Disposable fields when passed from the outside should not be disposed,"**Version Used**:

**Steps to Reproduce**:

According to [CA2213](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/code-quality/ca2213-disposable-fields-should-be-disposed?view=vs-2019) only disposable fields that were created locally should be disposed inside the `Dispose` method. But **If the object is created or assigned outside of type T the rule does not fire. This reduces noise for cases where the containing type doesn't own the responsibility for disposing of the object.**.

It means that the following code should not trigger IDE0069:

```csharp
internal class FooBar : IDisposable
{
    private readonly Stream _d;

    public FooBar(Stream d)
    {
        _d = d;

    }

    public override string ToString()
    {
        return _d.ToString();
    }
}

The error list sometimes shows this error until you navigate to it. Then it disappears. Other times the VS build fails and the error list stays showing 0 errors. If you specify the type argument the IDE greys it because it's redundant.

38897,References to VB.NET methods are not showing up in CodeLens if they are in an aspx page.,"_This issue has been moved from [a ticket on Developer Community](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/content/problem/720917/references-to-vbnet-methods-are-not-showing-up-in.html)._

---
What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Create a VB.NET class in project A with some methods
2. Create an aspx page in a separate project B in the same solution.
3. In one of the aspx pages refereence one of your methods from project A.
4. Look at CodeLens  for your methods in project A.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
Expected: CodeLens shows usages of the methods.
Actual: CodeLens does not show usages of the methods; you hvae to use Find to find them.

38896,The IDE does not respect 'open brace on new line' preferences for switch expressions.,"_This issue has been moved from [a ticket on Developer Community](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/content/problem/719582/the-ide-does-not-respect-open-brace-on-new-line-pr.html)._

---
The 'fix formatting' option and automatic formatting seem to really want to put the open brace on a new line in code such as the following:
```
allWires.Append(i switch {
	0 =&gt; &quot;CutFirstWire CutSecondWire&quot;
	1 =&gt; &quot; CutThirdWire&quot;
	2 =&gt; &quot; CutFourthWire&quot;
	3 =&gt; &quot; CutFifthWire&quot;
	_ =&gt; &quot;&quot;
});
```
This occurs even with `csharp_new_line_before_open_brace = none` specified in `.editorconfig` and there is no option in the GUI for switch expressions. Such an option should be added.

---
See example code to reproduce the issue.
You can format with Edit/Advanced/Format Document

Note that both lines using `new T()` contain U+00A0 character which is of Zs category and thus a valid space.
The `{typeof(T)&nbsp;new&nbsp;T()}`  will become `{typeof(T)newT()}` after formatting resulting in compilation error.

Reproduced with 16.2.3

Fixes #38819

### Customer scenario

When a user with indentation set to hard tabs is editing code the code will not be correctly indented in some cases. These cases include:

* The caret is placed to the left of the first non-whitespace character but not all the way left to column 1. For example the caret is typically in an affected location if the user presses <kbd>Home</kbd>.
* The caret is placed between two parts of a compound statement such as the situation described by https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/38819#issuecomment-534728599.

### Workarounds if any

None.

### Risk

Low.

### Performance impact

Negligible. No significant changes to existing code paths.

### Is this a regression from a previous update?

Yes regression from previous minor version.

### Root cause analysis

Hard tabs was an untested configuration for indentation. The existing test suite was updated to also test hard tabs for indentation in all scenarios previously covered by spaces only.

### How was the bug found?

Customer reported.

### Test documentation updated?

It is possible that the result of Rude Edit semantic analysis of an unchanged document will change if there another document is updated. If we encounter a significant case of this we should consider caching such a result per project rather then per document. Also we might be observing an older semantics if the document that is causing the change is out-of-sync --
e.g. the binary was built with an overload C.M(object) but a generator updated class C to also contain C.M(string) which change we have not observed yet. Then call-sites of C.M in a changed document observed by the analysis will be seen as C.M(object) instead of the true C.M(string).",Area-Interactive|Interactive-EnC,26/09/2019 1:56:11 AM +00:00,,

38822,IDE1008 when constructor called without optional parameters inside incomplete lambda,"**Version Used**: .NET Core 3.0.100 (stable) Visual Studio Community 2019 version 16.3.0 (stable)

``` csharp
using System;

namespace Test
{
    public class InstanceType
    {
        public InstanceType(object? a = null) { }
    }

    public static class Example
    {
        public static void Test()
        {
            Action lambda = () =>
            {
                var _ = new InstanceType();  // IDE1008: 'InstanceType' does not contain a constructor that takes that many arguments
                var _ = 0  // CS1002: ; expected
            };
        }
    }
}
```

There are two types of errors displayed in this code:

* CS1002: This is expected.  My cursor is at the end of this line; I'm currently writing the remainder of the lambda.  I haven't completed the line yet.
* IDE1008: This is unexpected even with my code in an incomplete state.

For this issue to occur the following conditions have to be met:

* The constructor definition must have at least one optional parameter.
* The constructor call must omit at least one optional parameter.
* The constructor call must be inside a statement lambda.
* There must be an unterminated statement inside the lambda.

This is problematic in some scenarios.  For example say I'm in the process of writing a lambda:

``` csharp
Action lambda = () =>
{
    var a = new InstanceType();

    // ...

    a.  // My cursor is here.
};
```

I've written a line to instantiate an `InstanceType` and store it in `a`.  I want to do something with `a` so I type `a.` expecting to see autocompletion options.  The autocompletion list will appear but I'll also receive an error on my constructor call which brings into question the validity of the autocompletion results--did I make a mistake that will cause `a` to be a different type from what I intended?  So I go back to fix the error before completing the line on which I'm currently working--but the error isn't real.

Now I understand that this is incomplete code so errors are expected to appear.  However Visual Studio normally seems to be quite intelligent about handling incomplete code; for example this problem doesn't occur in normal method bodies only statement lambdas.  The errors it does display typically make sense such as when non-void lambda doesn't have a return statement yet.",Area-IDE|Bug|help wanted,24/09/2019 6:47:12 PM +00:00,,

2. Option to **disable live analyzer execution**: There have been lot of requests in past to give users a single knob to turn on/off execution of all Roslyn analyzers in the IDE (third party analyzers + IDE code style analyzers which are enabled by default).

I have also hooked up the low virtual memory listener which detects low VM and used to turn off just the full solution analysis to now instead turn on a forced power save mode for the current VS session (which also turns off full solution analysis along with other background analyses).

**TODOs:**
1. More manual testing
2. Get design consensus on the preferred option(s):
   1. 2 options (current PR): Options to configure Power save mode and Analyzer execution
   2. Single option to configure Power save mode only
   3. Multiple options: One top level option to configure Power save mode with lot of individual options to control individual background analyses. This is less preferable due to overload of options and information for users.",Area-IDE,23/09/2019 9:00:44 PM +00:00,,
38802,Move optimization around use of Nullable type in Boolean Expressions into LocalRewriter and eliminate invalid optimization.,"Fixes #38305.

The goal of optimization is to eliminate the need to deal with instances of Nullable(Of Boolean) type as early as possible and as a result simplify evaluation of built-in OrElse/AndAlso operators by eliminating the need to use three-valued Boolean logic. The optimization is possible because when an entire Boolean Expression is evaluated to Null that has the same effect as if result of evaluation was False. However we do want to preserve the original order of evaluation according to language rules.",Area-Compilers|Language-VB,23/09/2019 8:49:52 PM +00:00,,jcouv

38793,Analyzer driver perf optimization,"This change optimizes the analyzer driver to avoid redundant analyzer callbacks in presence of source file based suppressions to improve the overall performance for analyzer execution. Current editorconfig design allows user to configure diagnostic severities for specific source file(s). If user has suppressed all diagnostics that an analyzer can report on a specific file then executing the analyzer on such a file is redundant and can be avoided by the driver except for the below cases:

1. Non-configurable analyzers: If an analyzer reports any non-configurable diagnostic skipping any callbacks for this analyzer is not possible. User configurations will anyway not be respected and reported diagnostics cannot be suppressed.
2. Stateful analyzers (Compilation Start/End analyzers and Symbol Start/End analyzers): These analyzers have an analysis scope that is broader than a single file. They are handled separately based on whether or not they have registered to analyzer generate code:
   1. Registered to analyze generated code: Skipping any analyzer callbacks for these analyzers is not possible it will break the analyzers as they need to analyze all parts of the symbol/compilation to function properly. See analyzer [API](http://source.roslyn.io/#q=ConfigureGeneratedCodeAnalysis) for configuring generated code callbacks.
   2. Not registered to analyze generated code: Skipping analyzer callbacks for suppressed files for these analyzers is fine. By definition such analyzers do not require to analyze all files in compilation as it anyways skips generated code.
3. Symbol analyzers: Symbol analysis callbacks can only be skipped if the analyzer is suppressed on all files corresponding to symbol's declaration locations.",Area-Analyzers|Area-Compilers,22/09/2019 3:28:33 PM +00:00,8/10/2019 8:18:35 PM +00:00,agocke

38782,Problem with using common .editorconfig file (imported in csproj) in Visual Studio 2019 Preview 4,"**Version Used**: 

Visual Studio 2019 Preview 4
Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.FxCopAnalyzers v2.9.4

**Steps to Reproduce**:

I want to streamlime code analysis and the respetive rules accross multiple projects and teams.

We used to do that by having a NuGet package that imported analyzers to projects (Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.FxCopAnalyzers and StyleCop.Analyzers) and defined a ruleset to define how each rule was handled by VS (error warning etc.).

I have been trying to setup this using a common .editorconfig file instead of the ruleset. The problem is that settings like the following just seem to be ignored when the .editorconfig file is imported from a shared folder.

```
dotnet_diagnostic.CA1062.severity = error
```

For the purpose of testing this I have a very simple scenario that illustrates the problem.

The .editorconfig file is as follows:

```
[*.cs]
dotnet_diagnostic.CA1062.severity = error
#dotnet_code_quality.null_check_validation_methods = NotNull
```

Now this file is imported in a csproj like this:

```
<Project Sdk=""Microsoft.NET.Sdk"">
    <PropertyGroup>
        <TargetFramework>netstandard2.0</TargetFramework>
    </PropertyGroup>
    <Import Project=""..\..\_Shared\Build.props"" />
    <ItemGroup>
        <PackageReference Include=""Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.FxCopAnalyzers"" Version=""2.9.4"">
            <PrivateAssets>All</PrivateAssets>
        </PackageReference>
    </ItemGroup>
</Project>
```

Build.props is like this:

```
<Project>
    <PropertyGroup>
    <SkipDefaultEditorConfigAsAdditionalFile>true</SkipDefaultEditorConfigAsAdditionalFile>
    </PropertyGroup>
    <ItemGroup Condition=""Exists('$(MSBuildThisFileDirectory)\.editorconfig')"" >
        <AdditionalFiles Include=""$(MSBuildThisFileDirectory)\.editorconfig"" />
    </ItemGroup>
</Project>
```

**Expected Behavior**:

The following code is supposed to trigger an **error on CA1062** (validation of input):

```
public int Calculate(InputData input)
{
    SmartGuard.NotNull(nameof(input) input);
    if (this.Multiply)
    {
        return input.Value * 2;
    }
    else
    {
        return input.Value + 2;
    }
}
```

**Actual Behavior**:

But the result is a **warning** which means that `CA1062.severity` is being ignored.

Now if I change .editorconfig and uncomment the second line:

```
[*.cs]
dotnet_diagnostic.CA1062.severity = error
dotnet_code_quality.null_check_validation_methods = NotNull
```

The error goes way which means that `null_check_validation_methods` is being considered.

Why is that `CA1062.severity` is being ignored?

38776,Code Snippet replacement parameters do not respect spaces on insertion,"_This issue has been moved from [a ticket on Developer Community](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/content/problem/734632/code-snippet-replacement-parameters-do-not-respect.html)._

---
What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Create a code snippet that includes a literal replacement variable declaration where the placeholder is separated from succeeding text by one or more spaces as in:

```
&lt;Snippet&gt;
  &lt;Code Language=&quot;CSharp&quot;&gt;
    &lt;![CDATA[
      public class Serializer : JsonConverter&lt;$ClassName$&gt;
      {
          public override $ClassName$ ReadJson(JsonReader reader Type objectType $ClassName$ existingValue)
          {
          }
      }
    ]]&gt;
  &lt;/Code&gt;
  &lt;Declarations&gt;
    &lt;Literal&gt;
        &lt;ID&gt;ClassName&lt;/ID&gt;
        &lt;ToolTip&gt;Specify the name of the class to convert.&lt;/ToolTip&gt;
    &lt;/Literal&gt;
  &lt;/Declarations&gt;
&lt;/Snippet&gt;
```

2. Insert the snippet into a code file press Tab type the replacement parameter e.g. &quot;MyClass&quot; and then press Enter.
3. Observe the inserted code.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

Expected:

```
public class Serializer : JsonConverter&lt;MyClass&gt;
{
   public override MyClass ReadJson(JsonReader reader Type objectType MyClass existingValue)
   {
   }
}
```

Actual:

```
public class Serializer : JsonConverter&lt;MyClass&gt;
{
   public override MyClassReadJson(JsonReader reader Type objectType MyClassexistingValue)
   {
   }
}
```

Please provide any additional information below.

Spaces are removed after all instances of the inserted literal replacement parameter values rendering the entire snippet feature no better than copy-and-paste since the developer now has to manually examine the inserted code searching for every occurrence of the substituted variable.

38775,IntelliSense uses wrong types for lambdas passed using named parameters,"_This issue has been moved from [a ticket on Developer Community](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/content/problem/734521/intellisense-uses-wrong-types-for-lambdas-passed-u.html)._

---
If you have a method which accepts multiple lambdas as arguments and use named parameters to pass the lambdas in a different order IntelliSense within a passed lambda body will use the wrong types for completion against the lambda's parameters in the lambda body. That was a big sentence.

```csharp
void MethodWithMultipleLambdaArguments(
    Action<(int x int y)> action
    Action<IEnumerable<string>> checkThings = null)
{
    checkThings?.Invoke(new[]
    {
            ""a""
            ""b""
        });
    action((1 2));
}

public void DoSomething()
{
    MethodWithMultipleLambdaArguments(checkThings: things =>
    {
        things.«here»
    } action: pair =>
    {

    });
}
```

If you take the above code in a C# class in Visual Studio remove the “«here»” and then try completion from where “«here»” was you will see something like this:

![autocompletion for `action`’s parameter shown when completing against `checkThings`’s parameter](https://i.imgur.com/RhFi3QR.png)

I think that there is something like incomplete type information being calculated because the lambda has a syntax error preventing it from being fully resolved by the C# compiler. However in this case with named parameters and a limited number of possible matching method overrides (in this case exactly one) the compiler should have enough information to calculate the correct types for the lambda’s parameter.

#### Nathan Phillip Brink (binki) on 9/16/2019 06:43 AM: 

<p>P.S. in case it was not clear the expected behavior would be to show the completions for `IEnumerable&lt;string&gt;` since that is the type of the `things` parameter.</p>

38774,C# suggested parameter name is PascalCased,"_This issue has been moved from [a ticket on Developer Community](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/content/problem/735864/c-suggested-parameter-name-is-pascalcased.html)._

---
What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Write out a method signature including parameters.
2. After typing a parameter type press space.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

I expect the C# language service to suggest a parameter name based on the type name in camelCase.
Instead it shows it to me in PascalCase.

.NET naming has a very strong precedent for using camelCase for parameter names. C# used to do this properly but it seems to have regressed recently.
See screenshot.

[regression] [worked-in:16.3]
What steps will reproduce the problem?

1. Have an .editorconfig file with `dotnet_style_qualification_for_method = true:warning`
1. Define a local method
2. Use that local method name as the argument to a delegate constructor.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

I expect no warnings.

I see an IDE0009 warning saying I must qualify the local method reference with `this.`.
Yet of course if I add `this.` then there's an error because local methods must not be qualified that way.

38771,Switch expression conversion creates broken code due to unspecific var return,"_This issue has been moved from [a ticket on Developer Community](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/content/problem/725942/switch-expression-conversion-creates-broken-code-d.html)._

---
Hence the following code:

```cs
using System;

namespace ConsoleApp1
{
    interface IFruit { }
    class Apple : IFruit { }
    class Banana : IFruit { }

class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            IFruit fruit;
            switch (args[0])
            {
                case &quot;apple&quot;:
                    fruit = new Apple();
                    break;
                case &quot;banana&quot;:
                    fruit = new Banana();
                    break;
                default:
                    throw new InvalidOperationException(&quot;Unknown fruit.&quot;);
            }
            Console.WriteLine(fruit. ToString());
        }
    }
}
```

The switch expression conversion suggests creating the following code:
```
var fruit = (args[0]) switch // C8506 No best type was found for the switch expression.
{
    &quot;apple&quot; =&gt; new Apple()
    &quot;banana&quot; =&gt; new Banana()
    _ =&gt; throw new InvalidOperationException(&quot;Unknown fruit.&quot;)
};
```

However the use of `var` causes the error `No best type was found for the switch expression.` which should be `IFruit`. There is no helper to change `var` explicitly to `IFruit`. If the conversion would've taken the original declaration of `IFruit` or the nearest compatible type there would have been no problem.
```cs
IFruit fruit = (args[0]) switch
{
    &quot;apple&quot; =&gt; new Apple()
    &quot;banana&quot; =&gt; new Banana()
    _ =&gt; throw new InvalidOperationException(&quot;Unknown fruit.&quot;)
};
```

I don't expect helpers to create broken code; and it would be nice to have this fixed :-)

I expect for the URL to be opened in my default browser. Instead I get taken to the System.String class metadata or a decompiled version of the System.String reference assembly (which all no-op but that's another issue).

Currently the EditorConfig is only saved at the solution level and have to right click on the solution name in the Solution Explorer and select add existing item for the EditorConfig to show up in Solution Explorer and I believe we can eliminate that step as well:

38745,Enhance local variable assignment tracking,"**Version Used**: 

Visual-Studio-2019-Version-16.2.5

**Steps to Reproduce**:

Consider the following code snippet:

```
void Foo(object key)
{
    IDictionary<object object> dictionary = CreateDictionary(); // May return null
    // Bar() returns an object
    var foo = dictionary?.TryGetValue(key out object fooValue) ?? false ? fooValue : Bar();
    //                                                                     ~~~~~~~~
}
```
**Expected Behavior**:

The compiler can statically prove that in the branch `fooValue` is used it is always assigned.

**Actual Behavior**:
The comiler errors:

38723,Type pattern: definite assignment false positive for struct that has only reference type properties and is declared in another assembly,"**Version Used**: 
Visual Studio 16.2.5
MSBuild 16.2.37902+b5aaefc9f
csc.exe 3.2.1-beta4-19408-03

**Steps to Reproduce**:
You need two assemblies for this `Lib` and `App` where `App` references `Lib`.
```csharp
// Lib
namespace Lib
{
	public struct StructWithStringProp
	{
		public string Text { get; set; }
	}
}

// App
namespace App
{
	internal class CallSites
	{
		private static string ExternalStringPropCallSite(Lib.StructWithStringProp? nullable)
		{
			bool flag = nullable is Lib.StructWithStringProp notNull;
			return flag ? notNull.ToString() : """";
		}
	}
}
```

**Expected Behavior**:
error CS0165: Use of unassigned local variable 'notNull'

**Actual Behavior**:
The code compiles.

**Additional information**:
If you make any of the following changes the code stops compiling and the expected error appears:
- replace struct's property with a field
- change struct's property type from `string` to let's say `int`
- move struct declaration from Lib to App

You can check out a solution that illustrates all these permutations and their effect on the compiler behavior [here](https://github.com/HellBrick/RoslynPatternMatchingDefiniteAssignmentIssue).",Area-Compilers,17/09/2019 10:29:45 AM +00:00,17/09/2019 6:11:21 PM +00:00,

38718,Make certain parts of the nuget search update system non-cancellable.,"These codepaths only ever passed in CancellationToken.None in (outside of tests).  As such it's just somewhat confusing to actually attempt to use the token for any sort of real rpc purpose.  The token just exists so that tests can effectively cause the system to bail out of its infinite looping.  

In the real OOP scenario we just allow the normal process teardown mechanism to clean things up.  So we don't actually need to have anything control that loop.  Again this is how things have always worked.  So we basically have several years worth of information showing this lifetime management approach works and doesn't need changing. 

This PR just makes things clearer and reduces the chance for confusion here.

--

Note: to reiterate.  There should be no runtime change in behavior here.  This change just codifies what our existing implementation already does and reduces confusion due to the existence of a cancellation token being used in non-test scenarios that had no effect.",Area-IDE|Community,16/09/2019 11:52:21 PM +00:00,4/10/2019 1:24:30 AM +00:00,sharwell

38702,The compiler produces code with useless redundant instructions for `(X Y) = (x y)`,"**Version Used**: Visual Studio 2019 (16.2.5) dotnet SDK v2.2.402

**Steps to Reproduce**:

1. `dotnet new console`
2. Create `Point.cs` file with `Point` class from [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tuples#deconstruction)
3. `dotnet build -c Release`
4. Open the compiled DLL in the ILSpy and inspect `Point` class constructor.

**Expected Behavior**: The compiler will produce short and efficient code

**Actual Behavior**: The compiler produces code with useless redundant instructions

The code of example from documentation:
```
public class Point
{
    public int X { get; set; }
    public int Y { get; set; }

    public Point(int x int y) => (X Y) = (x y);
}
```

The constructor compiles to:
```
.method public hidebysig specialname rtspecialname 
	instance void .ctor (
		int32 x
		int32 y
	) cil managed 
{
	// Method begins at RVA 0x2074
	// Code size 29 (0x1d)
	.maxstack 3
	.locals init (
		[0] int32
		[1] int32
		[2] int32
	)

	IL_0000: ldarg.0
	IL_0001: call instance void [System.Runtime]System.Object::.ctor()
	IL_0006: ldarg.1
	IL_0007: stloc.0
	IL_0008: ldarg.2
	IL_0009: stloc.1
	IL_000a: ldarg.0
	IL_000b: ldloc.0
	IL_000c: dup
	IL_000d: stloc.2
	IL_000e: call instance void RoslynBug.Point::set_X(int32)
	IL_0013: ldarg.0
	IL_0014: ldloc.1
	IL_0015: dup
	IL_0016: stloc.2
	IL_0017: call instance void RoslynBug.Point::set_Y(int32)
	IL_001c: ret
} // end of method Point::.ctor
```
This is equivalent of:
```
public Point(int x int y)
{
	int num2 = X = x;
	num2 = (Y = y);
}
```

But I was expected to get a result similar to this:
```
public Point(int x int y)
{
    X = x;
    Y = y;
}
```
Which compiles to a shorter (and I assume more efficient code):
```
.method public hidebysig specialname rtspecialname 
	instance void .ctor (
		int32 x
		int32 y
	) cil managed 
{
	// Method begins at RVA 0x2072

38701,Debugger* attributes are not applied to compiler generated classes for lambdas,"**Version Used**: The one shipped with VS 16.2.5

**Steps to Reproduce**:

1. Create a console application with the following code:

using System;
using System.Diagnostics;

namespace ConsoleApp1
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main()
        {

            // Single step into these calls
            test.TestLambdaWithoutCapture();
            test.TestLambdaWithCapture();
        }

        public static void Output(string text)
        {
            // Break here and inspect the call stack
            Console.WriteLine(text);
        }
    }

    [DebuggerStepThrough]
    class TestedClass
    {
        public void TestLambdaWithoutCapture()
        {
            Action action = () => Program.Output(""Test"");
            action();
        }

        public void TestLambdaWithCapture()
        {
            string text = ""Test"";
            Action action = () => Program.Output(text);
            action();
        }
    }
}
```

2. Place breakpoints at the commented lines.
3. Step into the method calls in `Main`.
4. For each call inspect the call stack once the breakpoint in the `Output` method is hit.

**Expected Behavior**:

- Single stepping into the methods should put the execution pointer directly to the `Output` method.
- Inspecting the call stack in the `Output` method should not show any method of the `TestedClass`.

**Actual Behavior**:

- Single stepping into the methods puts the exectuion pointer inside the lambda expressions.
- Inspecting the call stack in the `Output` method shows a method with ""AnonymousMethod"" in its name.

**Additional Information**:

- I've added both a test with and without capture variables because the compiler before Roslyn generated static methods (which would not show the bug) for the non-capture case. Although Roslyn doesn't do this right now I added the case to be sure.
- If you apply the ""IDE0039 Use local function"" refactorings that are shown for the example code the tests work fine (because static methods are generated for the local functions instead of the classes that are generated for lambdas).
- I think all three attributes (`DebuggerStepThroughAttribute` `DebuggerHiddenAttribute` and `DebuggerNonUserCodeAttribute`) should be propagated to the generated class. And it should propagate from attributes applied to the method as well as attributes applied to the class.

38685,Consider forcing all relevant compilations into /highentropyva,"Are there good reasons why we wouldn't force all 64-bit managed compilations into emitting the HighEntropyVA DLL characteristic? The compiler already forces the dynamic base characteristic. I'm not aware of a good reason to allow a managed compilation to not enable high entropy VA (as doing so provides no substantive gain AFAIK such as a perf improvement in exchange for the regression in security). 

In emerging Dotnet/AOT (ahead of time compilation) scenarios this bit on a managed assembly isn't relevant as it is automatically applied when the image that is actually used to load the binary is produced: https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/20444/files 

Absent some contrary rationale my suggestion is to make a similar change to Roslyn that would forcibly add this DLL characteristic to 64-bit exe compilations.

This would make the managed runtime a more secure place. We would avoid the next occurrence of discovering that some emergent <HighEntropyVA> targets property does not have a secure default and help eliminate some complexity that exists in security analysis of managed portable executables.

38675,Add AnalyzerConfigOptionSet to get Option values from AnalyzerConfig,"Currently most of the CodeStyle diagnostic analyzers rely on receiving a `WorkspaceAnalyzerOptions` (an Internal type) so that they can get a `OptionSet` to pull option values from. For projects that have .editorconfig files these option value can now be pulled from `AnalyzerConfigOptions` (a Public type).

This PR adds a AnalyzerConfigOptionSet that will first try to pull the Option value from `AnalyzerConfigOptions` and fall back to the document's `OptionSet` when no value is found. This benefits environments that have .editorconfig files and run analyzers but do not have permissions to create instances of `WorkspaceAnalyzerOptions`.",Area-IDE,12/09/2019 11:56:14 PM +00:00,,
38674,Bulk configuration/suppression of analyzer diagnostics,"## User scenarios
Lot of internal discussions and external requests in the area of analyzer adoption have pointed to a need for a better _bulk diagnostic configuration_ story based on real world user scenarios such as:

1. **Default severity configuration to reduce analyzer noise and remove analyzer adoption barriers**: I want to configure the default severity of all analyzer diagnostics (from every analyzer package that I have installed in my project) without having to configure every single diagnostic ID. For example demote all analyzer diagnostics to be _suggestions by default_ so they are equivalent to IDE code style suggestions which do not affect my CI builds and do not pollute my editor with squiggles and tons of warnings and errors. This breaks the analyzer adoption barrier as installing a new analyzer package has no drastic implications on my workflow. It allows me to opportunistically fix analyzer diagnostics whenever I want to address them and selectively promote individual diagnostic IDs that I want to execute in CI to warning/error severity with explicit diagnostic ID based configuration entries. This allows the end users to choose opt-in vs opt-out model for analyzer execution in CI.
2. **Category based configuration to prioritize buckets of analyzer diagnostics**: I want to configure all diagnostics with a specific diagnostic [category](http://source.roslyn.io/#Microsoft.CodeAnalysis/Diagnostic/DiagnosticDescriptor.cs45) without having to manually identify and configure every single diagnostic ID in that category. For example bump up all security rules to errors demote all performance issues to suggestions etc. These are extremely common operations during targeted code quality work such as security push performance push maintenance push etc.
3. **Suppress all current and future analyzer diagnostics inside a specific file or folder**: say legacy code folders or documents based on extensions (for example generated code with special extensions: https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/3705) etc. This issue has long been known as one of the biggest analyzer adoption barrier that needs an end user configuration point to reduce analyzer noise. Requiring end users to add custom autogenerated comments at top of their generated code files may not always be feasible or scalable and is also an unnecessary burden for customers. Performing a baseline operation  in Visual Studio (`Build and suppress active issues` command in `Analyze` menu) only suppresses diagnostics from current project/solution snapshot and also generates a very hard to maintain list of in-source suppressions (pragmas or suppress message attributes). 

## Difficulties with current support
Each of the above actions are very common when installing a new analyzer package or doing targeted code analysis cleanup work (for example security push performance push code maintenance push etc.). [Current support for diagnostic configuration](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/code-quality/use-roslyn-analyzers) requires user to configure each diagnostic ID with a distinct configuration entry per diagnostic ID reported by every analyzer from all of the consumed analyzer packages. This approach becomes even more untenable with analyzer package upgrades which generally brings in bunch of new analyzers and diagnostics IDs and requires the user to manually update their per-ID configuration lists to include the new diagnostic IDs.

## Design Proposal - editorconfig options for analyzer driver
In past adding any such bulk diagnostic configuration support would have required providing new MSBuild and command line compiler switches or updating existing ones which had a high implementation and design cost and higher risk of bugs/regressions. With the recently added support in [VS2019 16.3](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/releases/2019/release-notes-preview#16.3.0-pre.3.0) to pass in project's .editorconfig files into the compiler for analyzer configuration implementing this feature has become considerably easier.

Proposal is to _allow end users to specify editorconfig options that are respected by the core analyzer driver in the compiler layer_. Proposed formats for analyzer driver options:

```
# Format 1 - configure default severity for all analyzer diagnostics
dotnet_analyzer_diagnostic.severity = error | warning | suggestion | silent | none

# Format 2 - configure default severity for analyzer diagnostics with a specific 'diagnostic_category'
dotnet_analyzer_diagnostic.<%diagnostic_category%>.severity = error | warning | suggestion | silent | none

# Format 3 - suppress all/category-based analyzer diagnostics for specific files/folders
dotnet_analyzer_diagnostic.suppress = true | false
dotnet_analyzer_diagnostic.<%diagnostic_category%>.suppress = true | false
```

Using the above supported formats the user scenarios listed in this issue can be addressed with following simple configuration entries:
```
# Scenario 1 - switching all analyzer diagnostics to be suggestions by default and promoting individual diagnostics to warning/error
[*.cs]
dotnet_analyzer_diagnostic.severity = suggestion
dotnet_diagnostic.CA1801.severity = warning
dotnet_diagnostic.CA1802.severity = error

# Scenario 2 - category based diagnostic configuration
[*.cs]
dotnet_analyzer_diagnostic.security.severity = error
dotnet_analyzer_diagnostic.correctness.severity = warning
dotnet_analyzer_diagnostic.performance.severity = suggestion

# Scenario 3 - suppress all analyzer diagnostics except security ones on my generated code
[*.MyGeneratedFileExtension.cs]
dotnet_analyzer_diagnostic.suppress = true
dotnet_analyzer_diagnostic.security.suppress = false
```

Possible future enhancements:
1. Allow bulk configuration of diagnostics from specific analyzer package or for all diagnostics with a specific diagnostic prefix say `dotnet_analyzer_diagnostic.CA.severity = ...` would only configure diagnostics with a `CA` prefix. I suggest we don't add such a functionality until it is required and we can provide specific user scenarios where the other proposed formats are not sufficient.",4 - In Review|Area-Analyzers|Feature Request,12/09/2019 10:57:31 PM +00:00,8/10/2019 7:05:42 PM +00:00,mavasani

38666,Fix OOM from SymbolUsageAnalysis,"We were allocating large number of BasicBlockAnalysisData instances during Merge operations when performing symbol usage analysis for locals/parameters and holding onto these until the whole method has been analyzed before returning them to a shared pool. This approach works fine for most cases except for extremely large methods with large number of local variables such that the analysis needs multiple flow analysis iterations (and hence merges) over the CFG.
This PR fixes this issue by returning the allocated BasicBlockAnalysisData instances during Merge operations immediately back to the shared pool. I also added another optimization to reduce the size of tracked per-basic block analysis data by removing tracking locals as and when they go out of scope.

38641,Order of evaluation for string concatenation still does not follow C# specification,"**Version Used**: VS2019.3 Preview 3 / Roslyn 3.3.0-beta2

#35006 claims to have fixed #522 but the new behavior implemented does not match the C# specification either.

**Expected Behavior**:
If I understood the specification correctly the + operator applied to `object + string` should:
  1. Evaluate the left-hand side as an object
  2. Evaluate the right-hand side as a string
  3. Call `ToString` on the object in order to convert it to a string
  4. Concatenate the two strings

**Actual Behavior**:
Starting in Roslyn 3.3.0-beta2 the actual behavior no longer matches the specification even in cases with only two operands (the old behavior only differed from the specification when there were more than two operands see #522 for details).
The new implemented behavior is:
  1. Evaluate the left-hand side as an object
  2. Call `ToString` on the object in order to convert it to a string
  3. Evaluate the right-hand side as a string
  4. Concatenate the two strings

**More than two operands**:
The expected behavior gets more tricky when there are multiple operands involved.
For
```
new C(0) + GetString() + new C(1)
```
The `+` operator groups left-associative so we're evaluating `(new C(0) + Space()) + new C(1)`. The outer `+` first evaluates the LHS so from the spec I would expect the evaluation order:
 * `new C(0)`
 * `GetString()`
 * `C(0).ToString()`
 * `new C(1)`
 * `C(1).ToString()`
But that's not what the Roslyn master currently does; it instead results in:
```
new C(0)
C(0).ToString()
GetString()
new C(1)
C(1).ToString()
```
Effectively Roslyn master immediately converts the non-string to string before even evaluating the other argument to `string.op_Addition(object string)`.
[Full example for 3 operands on SharpLab](https://sharplab.io/#v2:C4LgTgrgdgNAJiA1AHwAICYCMBYAUAAkP1QGZj18BZATwGEAbAQwGdm8j8BvdjojdHry6ChfTAE4AFFACmAd3y1JABgCU+RPgDKAB0YBjGZPWbZCpZlWqA3CNHEJx2wXtipNu6NSOzilSfxJXQMjAN8LKw8XIQBfT0JvADZtYDAASygAc209Q2NhaNdvKQAiYLzVEqjXPgB2fBKG53s4wtaRDEURblx4sBlGOAB7KHpqfAzgCed44jIlSYnVWZ6awmAACzTmADo0/ABeadmOYskAEhLwyU40mMrq0XbC07IhgDcZMHS4GQdlfAAFSGWlSGUyxhWJzcFxKSlu9x2wNB6SyxiqzTWqHqaSRILBaMesRErSAA==)

It gets even more interesting if we use parentheses to re-group the concatenation:
```
Console.WriteLine(new C(0) + (GetString() + new C(1)));
```
Now from the spec I would expect this evaluate as in `op_Addition(object op_Addition(string object))` so:
* `new C(0)`
* `GetString()`
* `new C(1)`
* `C(1).ToString()`
* `C(0).ToString()`
Roslyn master evaluates this as:
```
new C(0)
C(0).ToString()
GetString()
new C(1)
C(1).ToString()
```

So my takeaway is: The old compiler was optimizing string concatenation in a way that doesn't follow the language spec; the new compiler is optimizing string concatenation further in a way that still doesn't follow language spec.
Though arguably this time one could say that it's the spec that is broken. The new compiler behavior intuitively makes sense: every object is immediately converted to string before evaluating any further operands.

38607,[Question] Why I was able to overrid a implemented method with an extension method?,"Hi corefx Team

I have a big Question to the following Code:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;

public class Program
{
  public static void Main()
  {
    bla test = new blup();    
    Console.WriteLine(test.Any());
    
  }
}
public class blup: bla{
  public bool Any(){
    return true;
  }
}
public class bla{

}
public static class Extensions{
  public static bool Any(this bla klaus){
    return false;
  }
}
```

The `Console.WriteLine(test.Any())` returns `false`. So the extension method was called. But in the [documentation ](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/extension-methods#binding-extension-methods-at-compile-time) about extension methods there is this sentence `You can use extension methods to extend a class or interface but not to override them.`.
But this is not true for the code above.

The simple answer is that the IL only knows the static code and not the runtime values. So with the explicit casting in the line `bla test = new blup();` to `bla` the IL think the extension method is the right thing. 
But this is maybe a big problem. In my real case I have a class that inherited from `IEnumerable` and tries to override extension methods like `Any`. But like in the sample above that wouldn't work in a function that wants an `IEnumerable` as input like this:

```csharp
public void sample(IEnumerable<supertype> source)
```
In this method always the extension method for `IEnumerable` is preferred. Because at compile time you can't know the real type.

So now to the question:

Is this behavior by design or is this a bug?

And question number 2:

How I can override the extension methods of IEnumerable for my type so all functions in the framework use my implementations?",Area-Compilers|Question|Resolution-Answered,10/09/2019 3:40:44 PM +00:00,11/09/2019 9:08:43 PM +00:00,

1. Create a C# Project.
2. Add an `.editorconfig` file with `csharp_style_var_elsewhere = true`:
```

4. Invoke a Code Cleanup profile that includes ""Apply implicit/explicit type preferences"".

While this is probably not the best style of code (and I'd rather encourage the use of `new Dictionary<string (int One int Two)>()` - which in fact is the fix I applied afterwards); refactorings in combination with `.editorconfig` directives should not cause code that was previously fine to fail compiling afterwards.

---
When C# Code Style/Formatting Automatically format on paste is set unwelcome and unspecified changes are made around attributes.

In particular this
```
[Foo] void Bar() {
var x = 1;
    }
```
becomes this
```
[Foo]
void Bar() {
    var x = 1;
}
```

Note that the assignment statement and closing brace are moved in a way that is consistent with my CodeStyle settings. However an extra line feed is added after the attribute.

I realize that some people perhaps most people prefer the extra line. Nonetheless this convention should not be forced on all users. The default for code styling should be that if a feature/convention is not specified then leave it as-is. There is no code style option for attribute placement.

Defect: Code Style operations should leave attribute placement elements as-is

Feature Suggestion: Provide Code Style options for attribute placement.

38561,Null reference warning when validation expression result relayed as boolean,"If I write the following code
```
public void DoSomething(string value) {
  Console.WriteLine(value.Length);
}
```
I will receive the warning 
> `CA1062`: In externally visible method `void DoSomething(string value)` validate parameter `value` is non-null before using it. If appropriate throw an `ArgumentNullException` when the argument is null or add a Code Contract precondition asserting non-null argument.

Similarly in a slightly different construction—such as retrieving the value from a function that may result in a `null` value—I may receive:
> `CS8602`: Dereference of a possibly null reference.

This is totally expected; after all the parameter `value` may well be `null` since `#nullable` doesn't include runtime checking. As the warning suggests I can easily fix this by adding a guard clause such as:
```
public void DoSomething(string value) {
  if (value == null) {
    throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(value));
  }
  Console.WriteLine(value.Length);
}
```
If however I store the result of the validation expression (`value == null` in this case) to a `bool` and check that value I will still get the `CA1062` (or `CS8602`) warning:
```
public void DoSomething(string value) {
  var isInvalid = value == null;
  if (isInvalid) {
    throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(value));
  }
  Console.WriteLine(value.Length);
}
```
My expectation would be that the previous two code examples would yield the same results. 

This may well be expected based on Roslyn's flow analysis implementation. That said it limits the methods through which `null` references can be validated. For example it restricts the use of utility methods that assist in creating guard clauses similar in _structure_ to Code Contracts:
```
public static void Requires<T>(bool isValid) where T : Exception new() {
  if (!isValid) {
    throw new T();
  }
}
```
> **Note:** This is obviously a contrived example. A real implementation would be far more sophisticated accounting for e.g. variable names and/or error messages.

On the other hand implementing the same interface twice directly and with nullability differences arguably should produce an error instead of just a warning:

Finally this behavior is not consistently enforced on type constraints: direct scenarios (`where T : I<object?> I<object>`) produce an error and indirect scenarios (`where T : I<object?> IObjectUnannotated`) produce no diagnostic.

38550,Reuse previously resolved missing assembly metadata objects when identity doesn't match,"Fixes https://github.com/dotnet/try/issues/345.

**Background**
When the compiler is resolving compilation references and encounters a reference whose assembly identity does not match any of the explicitly given references it falls back to a Reference Resolver. In regular compilation an error is reported since there is no Reference Resolver. Interactive compiler supplies a resolver that attempts to find the missing reference. 

Once the missing reference is found the compiler adds it to the list of implicitly resolved assemblies and if the same missing assembly identity is referenced later (by a subsequent submission) it reuses the assembly symbol from this list so that we don't end up loading multiple instances of the same missing assembly. [1]

The resolver may find an assembly that matches the name of the missing reference but doesn't match the version exactly. This is expected as a newer version of the assembly may be available than was referenced and the compiler correctly binds to the newer version. 

**Issues** 
The first submission added a reference to a netstandard20 library on .NET Core and the subsequent submission referenced a type from that library. The reference resolution in the compilation corresponding to the second submission ended up adding a new distinct reference to the library instead of reusing the one that was already resolved for the first submission compilation.

This was caused by mismatch in versions of some of the facades transitively referenced by the library thru `netstandard.dll` reference and resolved thru the missing reference resolution mechanism. The facades ware referenced with different versions than the actual versions available in the set of references the Reference Resolver resolved missing references from. The compiler ended up using two distinct instances of the same facade assembly metadata. An assembly symbol is only reused if all its transitively referenced assemblies match. In this case the library assembly symbol wasn't reused because some of the facade assembly symbols did not match.

The problem was that the mechanism [1] didn't reuse missing assembly metadata with a different version than what was requested. The fix is to reuse all successful resolutions based on referenced identity.

Another issue found during testing is handing resolution failures. We did not remember that a resolution of a given assembly identity failed and attempted to resolve the assembly again in the next submission. This may lead to inconsistencies and the same ""can't convert T to T"" errors since first submission might have a missing assembly symbol and next might create a real assembly symbol for the same assembly identity. The fix is to capture both successful and failed resolution results.",Area-Compilers,6/09/2019 5:49:33 PM +00:00,17/09/2019 2:23:23 AM +00:00,

**Actual Behavior**:
I think the previous code is transformed into a `String.Format` method call even if there are no `{ }` between the double quotes.

**Expected Behavior**:
It's better if the `$` is just ignored and the code is treated as

```csharp
var x = ""Some string"";
```

**Update:**

As pointed by @huoyaoyuan  The compiler seem to really ignore the `$` when there is nothing to interpolate. but the following two lines behave differently for warnings:

Add the option to automatically add a using statement with an alias instead. I have a class that I need a using but I don't want to include everything in that namespace so I need something like this : 
`using MyClass = Namespace.Something.MyClass`

It would be nice if it was in the suggestions instead of the more common `using Namespace.Something`

> It would be great that while creating a new project I could select what type of design or paradigm I would like to keep such as DDD or TDD and then during development some scafolding of the main concepts may happens. On DDD Entity Event AgregateRoot classes for example. On DDD for example when creating some class the Visual studio could show some hints. if the developer was writing logic methods referencing many times some class a suggestion could pop up saying : “ it looks like this is domain logic to this entity.. if so consider moving this to the class” . Or in another use case. Regarding if a developer choose TDD when any new public or internal method of some class was created... a pop up would say:” you have chosen TDD in this project! You should start with the unit tests! “

3.3.0-beta3-19407-03+d961190a1b4b2a81ac178b567840dfeff048b037

**Steps to Reproduce**:

There are certain language features that could use a bit more tooling support this is one of those situations. I would like to see a styling option for refactoring that enabled code that looks like this:

```csharp
class Program
{
    class FooBar 
    {
        readonly IServer _server;
        readonly IActor _actor;

        public FooBar(IServer server IActor actor) 
        {
            _server = server;
            _actor = actor;
        }
    }
    
    interface IServer { }
    interface IActor { }
}
```
To be converted to this:

```csharp
class Program
{
    class FooBar 
    {
        readonly IServer _server;
        readonly IActor _actor;

        public FooBar(IServer server IActor actor) 
        {
            (_server _actor) = (server actor);
        }
    }
    
    interface IServer { }
    interface IActor { }
}
```

Taking it a step further if the user has already defined that their styling preference is to prefer constructor expressions when possible -- the result of the refactoring would be as follows:

```csharp
class Program
{
    class FooBar 
    {
        readonly IServer _server;
        readonly IActor _actor;

        public FooBar(IServer server IActor actor) 
            => (_server _actor) = (server actor);
    }
    
    interface IServer { }
    interface IActor { }
}
```

These refactoring would need to work in the opposite manner too going from tuple to separate statements. This proposal comes from a conversation with @BillWagner @mikadumont and I were having in the [twitter verse](https://twitter.com/davidpine7/status/1169418926217973760?s=20).

I have to stipulate that I am somewhat old-school and have tried to disable _most-if-not-all_ auto-formatting.  All I want is the _guarantee_ that when I press [ENTER] the editor Inserts a newline plus indentation to place the cursor at (R+1 C).

**EXAMPLE 1**:  Start with the following code:
```
namespace Minimum
{
	public class Foo
	{
	}
}
```
Press [ENTER] [TAB] create a property then press [ENTER].  As expected the cursor will be indented correctly.

```
	public class Foo
	{
		public bool Bar { get; set; }
		// cursor is here
	}

```
Do the same with #region Methods[ENTER] and you get
```
	public class Foo
	{
		#region Methods
	// cursor is here but should be 1 indentation right
	}

```
**EXAMPLE  2**: Start with the following code:
```
	public class Foo
	{
		#region Properties

// cursor is here

public bool Bar { get; set; }

#endregion Properties
	}
```
Type #region [SPACE] and you get
```
	public class Foo
	{
		#region Properties

#region // code has been shifted left

public bool Bar { get; set; } // code has been shifted left

#endregion Properties
	}
```
this behavior even skips regions e.g.
```
	public class Foo
	{
		#region Properties

// cursor is here

#endregion Properties

#region Methods

public void Bat()
			{
				// NOOP
			}

#endregion Methods
	}
```
Type #region[SPACE] and you get:
```
	public class Foo
	{
		#region Properties

#region // code has been shifted left

#endregion Properties

#region Methods

public void Bat() // code has been shifted left
			{
				// NOOP
			}

#endregion Methods
	}
```

With the code `string test = ""this is a test"";` if the cursor is put after &quot;is&quot; and the enter key is pressed VS maintains the string (ie it changes the code to `string test = ""this is"" + "" a test"";` split across both lines). The same should be done with comments. If the comment `//This is a test` exists and the cursor is put after &quot;is&quot; with the enter key pressed the resulting 2 lines should be

```
//This is
// a test

Currently what happens is the comment is broken with the resulting two lines being:

```
//This is
 a test

When you right click on a method name you get options on the context menu to wrap and align parameters.

Rather than picking the style of wrapping each time it is used I would like to be able to configure which style of wrapping is to be used for the whole solution in the code style options and save them to .editorConfig rather than having each developer choose on a case-by-ca se basis.

I would also like code cleanup to automatically wrap parameters using my chosen style when the line length is over a configured length.

---
when `override SomeVirtualOrAbstractMethod` is expanded and 
Options-&gt;Text Editor-&gt;C#-&gt;Code Style-&gt;Use expression body for methods is set to &quot;When on single line&quot; the generated piece of code looks like this:
```cs
protected override SomeVirtualOrAbstractMethod() => base. SomeVirtualOrAbstractMethod();
```

this is (in most cases) not wanted since the reason to override a method is to add custom behaviour (and usually also call the base class)

Thus the suggestion should be that an option is added to explicitely have the override expansion generated normal member bodies generating this code:
```cs
protected override SomeVirtualOrAbstractMethod()
{
    base. SomeVirtualOrAbstractMethod();
}
```

And the given file in an SDK style class library project:
``` csharp
using System;

namespace classLibrary1
{
    public interface fooInterface
    {
        
    }

    public class class1
    {
        public delegate void delegateFoo();

        public event EventHandler<class1> eventFoo;

        public static readonly string pubFoo = ""PubBar"";

        public const string conFoo = ""ConBar"";
        private const string foo = ""Bar"";

        private readonly string name;

        public class1(string Name)
        {
            string Local = """";

            name = Name ?? foo + Local;
        }

        public string getName()
        {
            doThing();
            DoOtherThing<object>();

            return name;

            void doThing()
            {

            }

            void DoOtherThing<arg>()
            {

            }
        }
    }
}
```

Open the file. Nearly every symbol was written to trigger naming rule breaks.

**Expected Behavior**:
Virtually every symbol should have a rule break warning. This works in 16.2.3.

**Actual Behavior**:
The interface `fooInterface` and the type arg in `DoOtherThing<arg>()` do not have warnings for breaking naming conventions.

38511,Generate Local variable outside of current block,"_This issue has been moved from [a ticket on Developer Community](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/content/idea/683584/generate-local-variable-outside-of-current-block.html)._

---
When Quick Actions suggest to create a local variable when we are in a code block (if using etc.) The local variable could be created outside of the block (just before)

This should be a new quick action or replacing the Create Local variable.

Example:

```
using (var db = CreateContext())
{
    blogs = db. Blogs.ToList()
}

```

The quick action is called on blogs

**Steps to Reproduce**:
Add this code:
```C#

class Program
{
    static void Main() { }

    static void M()
    {
        object? o;

Then type:
`o = new`
and hit space.  It pops up IntelliSense to complete the new expression:

**Expected Behavior**:
IntelliSense should select `object` not `object?`.

**Actual Behavior**:
The selected item is `object?` which is invalid in a constructor:

```
# Dotnet code style settings:
[*.{csvb}]
# Sort using and Import directives with System.* appearing first
dotnet_sort_system_directives_first = true

2. Open a .cs file with multiple `using` directives with a System directive at the bottom.
3. Format Document (Ctrl+K Ctrl+D)

**Expected Behavior**:
'Using' directives are re-ordered with System directives moved to top.

**Actual Behavior**:
No change in order of 'using' directives.


Additional Information:

Option to specify order of 'using' directives are found both in Tools>Options as well as editorconfig. 
- Run Default Code Cleanup command (Ctrl+K Ctrl+E) performs the re-ordering correctly when specified in .editorconfig (Value specified in .editorconfig supersedes value specified in Tool>Options as expected).
- Format Document doesn't seem to re-order the directives at all! (Regardless of what is specified in .editorconfig or Tools>Options.

38499,Sort completion list by pattern matching results,"Address #38253 with two tweaks

1. Sort completion list by pattern matching results first then by alphabetical order (current behavior is pure alphabetical order)
2. Selection will prefer unimported item with complete match if there's no in-scope items with complete match (current behavior is always prefer in-scope items even if it has worse matching than unimported items)

---------------------------------

- Ctrl + space when a complete match exists for both in-scope and unimported items. We will prefer in-scope items. Another impact of this change is in case there's no complete match we might end up selecting an in-scope item with better matched unimported items above the selection (not shown in the gif).

Since this is a potentially impactful change hide it behind an experiment for now.
Tag @ivanbasov @CyrusNajmabadi for review. 

FYI @davkean Does this address your feedback?

------------------------------- 

I have done some quick perf analysis which is based on the following scenario:

1. Open Roslyn.sln then navigate to the static constructor of `AbstractPersistentStorageTests` class. (I chose this file because it has ~20k items in the list with import completion enabled)
2. Ctrl + space to trigger completion list
3. slowly type ""task""
4. slowly delete ""task"" by using backspace
5. hit ""esc"" to discard completion list
6. go to step 2 and repeat for another 3 times

This is repeated 3 time with different roslyn release builds
1. Baseline: built directly from current master-vs-deps branch
2. With experiment disabled: with the change in this PR w/o enabling the experiments
3. With experiment enabled: does one more pass of sorting using pattern match otherwise identical to build 2 above.

Here's the results (CPU stacks in perfview with only frames under `ManagedModule!Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Editor.Implementation.IntelliSense.AsyncCompletion.ItemManager.UpdateCompletionList()` included)

1. Comparing experiment on and off. The extra sorting doesn't show in the diff at all.

2. Comparing baseline and with experiment enabled. It seems the perf is better with the change (~~216 ms~~ even better now see update below) due to calling pattern match fewer times.

Update:

**Steps to Reproduce**:

1. Set caret inside of a private non-static method
2. Type 'this.'

**Expected Behavior**:

Completion list is displayed with non-static member items of this class.

**Actual Behavior**:

Completion auto-completes to 'CallConvThiscall' and adds a using for `System.Runtime.CompilerServices`.

Auto-importing is nice but IMO needs to be a bit less aggressive. I frequently find myself needing to undo what it did. One obvious case is when the user types a keyword especially 'this' 'value' etc. These should never be considered for completion/auto-namespace-import or they should be added to the completion list so the keyword is the selected match when the user types a commit character.",Area-IDE|Bug,5/09/2019 12:15:25 AM +00:00,,

38494,Adjust dependency tracking for types with respect to added ability to nest types into interfaces.,"Related to #34704.

**We used to have the following rules:**

""When a class B derives from a class A it is a compile-time error for A to depend on B. A class **directly depends on** its direct base class (if any) and **directly depends on** the ~~**class**~~ within which it is immediately nested (if any). Given this definition the complete set of ~~**classes**~~ upon which a class depends is the reflexive and transitive closure of the **directly depends on** relationship.""

It is a compile-time error for an interface to directly or indirectly inherit from itself.
The **base interfaces** of an interface are the explicit base interfaces and their base interfaces. In other words the set of base interfaces is the complete transitive closure of the explicit base interfaces their explicit base interfaces and so on.

**Since we added ability to nest types into interfaces we are adjusting them as follows:**

When a class B derives from a class A it is a compile-time error for A to depend on B. A class **directly depends on** its direct base class (if any) and **directly depends on** the _**type**_ within which it is immediately nested (if any).

When an interface IB extends an interface IA it is a compile-time error for IA to depend on IB. An interface **directly depends on** its direct base interfaces (if any) and **directly depends on** the type within which it is immediately nested (if any).

Given these definitions the complete set of **types** upon which a type depends is the reflexive and transitive closure of the **directly depends on** relationship.",Area-Compilers|Language-C#|New Language Feature - Default Interface Impl,4/09/2019 11:52:36 PM +00:00,5/09/2019 7:53:00 PM +00:00,
38493,Enable xUnit2002: Assert.NotNull validation,"This enables xUnit analyzer rule xUnit2002 which validates the expression being passed to `Assert.NotNull` is not a value type. The Roslyn code base had ~2000 violations of this rule mostly due to passing `SyntaxToken` here. Presumably this is a historical artifact from the times when `SyntaxNode` was defined as a `class` instead of `struct`. 

The code was mechanically transformed in the following way:

``` csharp
// old
Assert.NotNull(token);
// new
Assert.NotEqual(default token)
```

I did give some consideration to just removing all the uses of `Assert.NotNull` when the argument passed in was side effect free (mostly locals). Eventually I decided against this though because I didn't want to mix potentially deleting valuable code with a mechanical transformation. If we do want to remove the non-sense comparisons here we should take that as a separate change.",Area-Compilers,4/09/2019 11:43:31 PM +00:00,6/09/2019 11:10:36 PM +00:00,jcouv

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/winforms/controls/defining-default-values-with-the-shouldserialize-and-reset-methods

When I have a member `void ResetX() {}` in a class inheriting from `System.Windows.Forms.Control` with a member `public object X { get; set; } ` Visual Studio incorrectly reports IDE0051 and provides a codefix to remove “unused code”. However that method is actually discovered and called by Designer if the user right-clicks on the property in the PropertyGridView and selects Reset.

Visual Studio should know about the private members that winforms will discover and not mark them unused. It should for example find unused members that are unused because the property referenced by the naming convention is not found. For example it should report `void ResetY() {}` as unused if there is no `public object Y { get; set; } `.

This is draft PR to aid/drive the design issues in https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/38480",Area-IDE,4/09/2019 2:50:10 PM +00:00,,
38480,Design issues around moving IDE code style analyzers to CodeStyle Analyzers NuGet package,"As part of https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/34907 we want to move as many IDE analyzers as possible into the CodeStyle analyzers NuGet package so the rules can be enforced on build/CI. We have already moved IDE0055 (Formatting analyzer) to this NuGet package and I tried to move an additional analyzer to the package (https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/38481) but ran into bunch of design questions/issues that need to be discussed.

1. **Diagnostic Analyzer:** This is the core piece that needs to be ported from IDE Features project to CodeStyle project. Design questions in this effort:
   1. **Should we re-use the same IDE diagnostic IDs for the ported analyzer?**
       Design Proposal: ""yes"" otherwise we run into issue about identical diagnostics with just a differing ID for each violation duplicate suppressions duplicate configuration (editorconfig/ruleset/nowarn entries) etc.
   2. **De-duping of diagnostics from different sources:** If we re-use the diagnostic IDs for the ported analyzer this will likely happen by default. We should confirm with @heejaechang. 
   3. **De-duping of diagnostic analyzers from different sources:** Given that the analyzer assembly containing these analyzers have different name (CodeStyle versus Features) there will be no automatic-deduping of analyzers and the analyzer from both these sources will execute. Do we care about the performance impact from duplicate analyzer execution? Should we add custom logic to IDE diagnostic service to not execute the IDE analyzer when there is an identical analyzer (say with same name and reporting same supported diagnostic IDs)?
   4. **Should we move the CodeStyle package to reference Microsoft.CodeAnalysis 3.x?** Currently the CodeStyle NuGet package targets Microsoft.CodeAnalysis 2.8.2 to enable running on Dev15 to promote dogfooding. However this prevents porting of bunch of analyzers which use APIs from Microsoft.CodeAnalysis 3.x. We can take couple of approaches here:
      1. Move to Microsoft.CodeAnalysis 3.x and officially state that newer CodeStyle NuGet packages are only supported with Dev16 and 3.x compiler toolset. Dev15 users can use prior CodeStyle packages.
      2. Stay on Microsoft.CodeAnalysis 2.8.2 and use Reflection based approach to light up analyzers using newer APIs if user is on Dev16.
      Personally I hate the reflection based approach and would strongly prefer just moving to Microsoft.CodeAnalysis 3.x.

2. **Code fixer:** This is likely the most controversial and tricky piece to port given that majority of our code fixers depend on internal IDE workspace and language services and extension methods which in turn use bunch of internal utilities helper utilities (for example symbol equivalence comparer) etc.
   1. **Should we port IDE code fixers to Code Style layer?** Theoretically speaking this is not required as code fixers never execute in CI. Following are the pros and cons of this porting effort:
      1. PROS:
         1. Code style layer can remain isolated from IDE and can be on par with other third party analyzer/fix packages. This can help us identify potential IDE internal APIs and utilities that should be made public.
         2. Protects us against breaking change in the analyzer where IDE code fixers do not need to handle all versions of analyzer (from different version of NuGet packages)
       2. CONS:
          1. Implementation cost: As mentioned above porting code fixers would likely be the most costly part of the port effort possibly also making this whole work item unfeasible and unrealistic.
          2. Unmaintainable code: The entire IDE Workspaces and Features layer would be filled with linked files #ifdefs based on code style preprocessor directive splitting of extension methods into two separate files one included in both Code Style and IDE layers and one only in IDE layer. IMO the code keeps getting pretty mess to work with and maintain.
           3. De-duping code fixers: We will end up showing duplicate identical code fixes from CodeStyle NuGet and IDE (need to confirm) which means we need to design a way to de-dupe code fixers and implement it. This would mean more work.

      **Design Proposal:** Given the extremely large number of highly impactful CONS and the overall implementation and maintenance cost likely being a deal breaker for this effort I would like to propose that we don't port the code fixers to code style layer. We should harden the code fixers so they gracefully bail out if the diagnostic location/properties is not as it expects so it can handle analyzer breaking changes gracefully and we can recommend customers to just upgrade to latest analyzer NuGet package to light-up the IDE code fixers again.

2. **Unit tests:** 
   1. **Should we port and/or clone unit tests for analyzers/fixers CodeStyle project?** We have following possible approaches each with its own PROS and CONS:
      1. **Clone unit test files into CodeStyle project:** This approach is only applicable if we decide that we are going to port the code fixers into CodeStyle NuGet layer otherwise the unit tests need to continue using IDE code fixers and hence cannot be moved to CodeStyle unit tests project. Formatting analyzer port did not port any existing formatting tests but added just a few additional formatting analyzer tests in the CodeStyle package for the ported analyzer. This approach will certainly not work for other analyzers as we want to run every authored analyzer/fixer unit test for both the IDE version of the analyzer and the ported analyzer in CodeStyle package. Creating cloned test files in CodeStyle unit test project will likely be impossible to maintain and keep them in sync with Features unit test project. Additionally if we decide not to re-use the IDE test framework and use the new Microsoft.CodeAnalysis testing library we will have to edit each and every ported unit test which will enormously increase the port and maintenance effort.
      2. **Link unit test files into CodeStyle project and continue using the IDE test framework:** This is comparatively much easier to implement and maintain compared to the prior approach. Again this approach is only applicable if we decide to port the code fixers into CodeStyle NuGet layer. I think this might be the most feasible approach if we decide to keep the CodeStyle package and its test project isolated from rest of Roslyn.sln.
      3. **Tweak the existing IDE test helpers in Features test project to test analyzers and/or fixers from both the Features and Code Style layer:** With this approach the core unit test helpers just have an additional test dimension where they run with CodeStyle analyzer and/or CodeStyle fixer (latter is needed if we decide to port the fixers). This would be similar to how our IDE analyzer/fixer tests run for both regular and script code kind by default. Each test file would just need to override a helper indicating additional analyzer/fixer against which to run all the tests. This approach would likely be minimal porting effort and also easiest to maintain.

**Overall Design Proposal:** I think we should try to keep a very good balance between ideal and practical aspects of the above approaches. I fear taking the ideal approach which would be to port analyzer code fixers and unit tests (also moving them to new analyzer/fixer test library) would make this effort almost impossible to complete.
IMO we should do the minimal implementation/maintenance cost approach which would be feasible and also gives end user value add: **port just the diagnostic analyzers and do not port the code fixers or unit tests** but just ensure that the code fixers are hardened against analyzer breaking changes and tweak existing IDE unit tests to also run with ported CodeStyle analyzers.

I think the check violates language specification however removing it might introduce a breaking change for existing code because types nested into interfaces were always supported by runtime and could be produced by other languages like VB etc. Removing the condition could resolve the identifier to a different type. For example if there was a type named C100 in the global namespace for the example above the C100 identifier in ```private C100 Test1() => null;``` would bind to that type. If we change lookup behavior to follow the spec it would silently find I100.C100 type instead.

38465,find all references and navigate to not using caches,"our code used to work without persistent service and persistent service was an optional component. if persistent service doesn't exist or doesn't work for whatever reason we used to cache find all reference or go-to index in memory.

this seems changed now and at the same situation it looks like we don't cache at all and re-calculate everything from scratch every single time.

it might be okay for one-off FAR or go to time to time but when doing that many times it shows big performance degradation.

the most common case for this is when one opens multiple VS for same solution (same sln file). then 1 VS will use cache and the other VS won't use any cache making second one very slow on these operations.

another case is one doing FAR or go to (SymbolFinder) on MSBuildWorkspace or AdhocWorkspace or any custom Workspace. these workspace will never use persistent service by default. so always get worst performance.

also it is not possible for them to enable persistent service since it requires location service (to know where to save the persistent file) and that service is internal and can't provided by users.

it would be nice to put back the in memory cache so that people can get in memory cache by default at least.

**Steps to Reproduce**:

I have a project which references many nuget packages. As a result there are at least 4 ILogger interfaces defined.

I have a constructor that takes MyLogging.ILogger.

```csharp
public class C
{
    public C(ILogger logger){}
}
```

MyLogging isn't imported and so I get a code fix to add using statements. However the suggestions only show the top 3 results which don't include MyLogging.ILogger.

Given how many classes have a constructor accepting ILogger this is quite annoying.

Would it be possible to sort the using statements to add based on how frequently they're used in the project?",Area-IDE|Concept-Continuous Improvement|Need Design Review,3/09/2019 6:00:32 PM +00:00,,ivanbasov

38447,Visual Studio crashes with FileNotFoundException in CompletionProvider if a NuGet package is used inside,"**Version Used**: 
2.9.0

**Steps to Reproduce**:

1. Create two projects (e.g. using ""code fix"" VS template): .NET Standard for custom CompletionProvider and .NET Framework for VSIX
2. Install 3rd party NuGet package to .NET Standard project and use it in the custom CompletionProvider (I tested on Microsoft.SqlServer.SqlManagementObjects).
3. Build the solution and run the VSIX. 

**Expected Behavior**:
All assemblies from the NuGet package are loaded correctly

**Actual Behavior**:
Visual Studio crashes with FileNotFound exception.
VSIX doesn't include assemblies from NuGet package at all.
If you try to install the same package to the VSIX project it is installed with .NET Framework as a target so Visual Studio is still not able to find the proper assembly.

**Supporting Information**:
A full example is available here:
https://github.com/dropsonic/DapperIntelliSense
To reproduce it open DapperIntelliSense.sln and run it in debug mode.
In the experimental VS instance open Samples/DapperTest.sln restore NuGet packages put the cursor to the end of `connection.Query<User>` and type `(""` to activate custom IntelliSense provider.",Area-External|Bug|IDE-IntelliSense,3/09/2019 1:03:52 PM +00:00,,
38446,Provide special error message and/or code fix for when a variable is referenced on the same line that it's initialized.,"This is a proposal stemming from https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/issues/2744 for if you want to see some additional discussion of it.

If you write the line
```csharp
Func<int int> factorial = n => n <= 1 ? 1 : n * factorial(n-1);
```
then you get the error `CS0165 Use of unassigned local variable 'factorial'`. The solution to this seems unclear at first but a lightbulb with a ""Use local function"" code fix pops up and that will of course resolve the issue.

However there are other situations where you won't be so lucky:
```csharp
class Foo : IFoo {
    public Func<IFoo> fooAction;
    public string fooString;
    public Foo (Func<IFoo> fooAction string fooString) {
        this.fooAction = fooAction;
        this.fooString = fooString;
    }
}

Foo obj = new Foo(() => obj ""Hello World!"");
```
Here the same error appears but no IDE assistance is provided to fix it leaving a programmer wondering how they can solve the issue. Of course simply initializing `obj` to another value (like `null`) before assigning it would work but the programmer wouldn't necessarily know that. I propose adding a special error message in this case for example `Use of unassigned local variable 'obj'. 'obj' must be initialized before it can be assigned in terms of itself.` or something like that (I'm not the greatest at writing good errors). Additionally I propose a code fix in this situation (possibly _only_ for when the variable is used in a lambda expression) to convert
```csharp
Foo obj = new Foo(() => obj ""Hello World!"");
```
to
```csharp
Foo obj = null; // or default
obj = new Foo(() => obj ""Hello World!"");

The underlying memory leak was fixed in the FlowAnalysis utilities assembly with https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn-analyzers/pull/2795. This PR just moves Roslyn to newer Flow analysis utilities package reference with the fix.

38440,"Preserve ""unsafe"" when refactoring between properties and methods","Fixes https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/38379.

The problem is that `ISymbol` does not expose the `unsafe` modifier which is why `DeclarationModifiers.From(ISymbol)` did not preserve it.

This PR changes `DeclarationModifiers.From(ISymbol)` so that it adds `unsafe` when it's clear from the `ISymbol` that it's necessary and also adds code to the refactoring to make sure `unsafe` is preserved even in cases where it's not clear from the `ISymbol`.

A similar change is also made to the reverse refactoring.",Area-IDE|Community,31/08/2019 4:51:44 PM +00:00,,mavasani
38439,Expose DataFlowAnalysis.UnassignedVariables through public API,"This is a feature request to expose some form of this property through a public API:
https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/007022c37c6d21ee100728954bd75113e0dfe4bd/src/Compilers/VisualBasic/Portable/Analysis/FlowAnalysis/VisualBasicDataFlowAnalysis.vb#L56

### Implementation straw man suggestion

Perhaps add this to `DataFlowAnalysis`:
```csharp
    /// <summary>
    /// The set of local variables for which a value is always assigned inside
    /// a region before being read
    /// </summary>
    public abstract ImmutableArray<ISymbol> DefinitelyAssignedBeforeRead { get; }
```
The VisualBasicDataFlowAnalysis and CSharpDataFlowAnalysis both already have a private property which is a `HashSet<Symbol> UnassignedVariables`

Performance aside DefinitelyAssignedBeforeRead would be implemented as something like:
```csharp
DeclaredVariables.Where(v => !UnassignedVariables.Contains(v))
```
Obviously the way I've named it arguably you might also want to filter out variables that are never read - naming is tricky. You could instead expose it with the name `NotDefinitelyAssigned` but I don't like having negatives in names much.

### Why it's useful (for me)
I maintain a [VB <-> C# code converter](https://github.com/icsharpcode/CodeConverter). When converting VB -> C# I'd like to initialize only the locals in C# that need to be initialized. The solutions that come to mind are:
* Make use of existing DataFlowAnalysis options
  * Can't find a way to make it work: In particular I'd hoped that `DataFlowsIn` would be false when the variable was uninitialized. This was not the case when tested for integers therefore from a given usage I can't figure out whether it's the first read or not.
* Use the VB diagnostics to detect the warnings for unassigned variables
  * Doesn't work: VB doesn't warn about value types that aren't initialized but C# does care
* Never write out an initializer then detect diagnostic issues in a post-pass of the C# and add them in.
 * Could be made to work but expensive and messy: An extra pass on an intentionally broken compilation is reasonably expensive performance-wise and some of the useful type information will have been lost unless carefully stashed away.
* Using reflection to get the internal property
 * Works but perilous: I'm using this at the moment but obviously any future release could change or totally remove this property.

### Other possible solutions
In my case there's a property right there doing what I need so it's tempting to just ask for it. However the underlying information seems interesting and valuable and I wonder if it's worth exposing some of it.

* Exposing the information on an `IOperation` - providing a method call to get which variables it reads and writes. 
* Adding more information to the `SymbolFinder.FindReferencesAsync` result about whether the reference is a read/write
* Documenting more of the subtle cases on the existing properties if you know they can give me what I need
* Closing this issue because it seems like a rare use case

I have a solution which is made up of multiple copies of the project-system repo (~400 projects in total). Looking a dump of the managed heap nearly 10% of the managed heap (243mb of 2.3Gb) is consumed by duplicated strings held by `CSharpSyntaxTree.ParsedSyntaxTree`. The issue is that the project-system repo has an .editorconfig that turns diagnostics on/off and `Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.AnalyzerConfigSet.GetOptionsForSourcePath` does substring parsing of rules of the form ""dotnet_diagnostic.<diagnostic>.severity"". Since it does this _for each syntax tree in the solution_ (~6 million of them in this case) each substring parse is duplicated over and over and over again. It looks like if `AnalyzerConfig.Section` just did this substring parsing once and passed back the same string for everyone this would eliminate the duplication.",Area-Analyzers|Concept-Continuous Improvement|Tenet-Performance,30/08/2019 9:50:25 PM +00:00,4/10/2019 10:48:50 PM +00:00,

38411,Collapse redundant types in the server,"The server has several instances of the following type hierarchy pattern:

```
interface IUtil { }
class Util : IUtil { }
class DesktopUtil : Util { } 
```

This was mostly done by myself for the following reasons:

1. At the time the compiler server only worked on desktop. It was believed that we'd need `CoreClrUtil` derivations to enable the same behavior on CoreClr. Luckily netstandard added all the types we needed hence we were able to use the `DesktopUtil` versions without modification.
1. There was a belief that we'd use an IPC mechanism other than named pipes on other operating systems. That is not the case as the named pipe implementation improved significantly and given a good deal of consistency across operating systems. 
1. Make it easier to test corner cases in the server. 

This change collapses many of the `DesktopUtil` types into the base `Util` type. 

There will likely be a few more of these changes. @agocke and I think the churn is worth the reduction in complexity and increase in code readability here.

---
When using AutoMapper in dotnet core 3.0 and C# 8 will nullable reference types I'm receiving a CS8602 error when using the `ForPath` method.

If `d.LastModifiedBy` is marked as nullable I receieve a warning for the following code:

`.ForPath(d => d.LastModifiedBy.UserId x => x.MapFrom(s => s.Transaction.LastModifiedBy))`

There should be a way for developers like those who work on AutoMapper to mark parameters as being null-safe. During mapping with the `ForPath` method AutoMapper will create the `d.LastModifiedBy` object and an exception will not occur.

The workaround is to surround all my . ForPath methods with `#pragma warning disable CS8602 // Dereference of a possibly null reference.`

This workaround could lead to additional null reference exceptions occurring such as if `s.Transaction` was null.

What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Create a new .NET Core 3.0 (preview 7 or 8) Console Project in latest Visua Studio 2019 16.2 or preview 2.0 16.3.0 
2.  Just paste the following code below into the editor (replace the existing code)
3. Visual Studio just hangs and after a while just crash

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

Editor shoudl not crash confirmed on a blank fresh installed Windows 10 with fresh install of latest VS2019 and .NET Core 3 preview.

Please provide any additional information below.

The code that I paste in (don't ask me why)  just copied from some website while exploring the non-nullable types feature.

```cs
#nullable enable

<p>16.2.3 would compile our work code 16.3.0 Preview 2 seemed to hang forever.</p>
<p>It is hard to provide a stereotype of the problem without all prod code. Extracting the essence ended with a section of code that would take a disproportionately long time to compile; but would complete in about a minute.</p>
<p>I repeated the troublesome clause 4 more times which causes RAM usage to blow up into the 10s of gigabytes (I went up to 40 then shut it off).</p>
<p>Leaving this code up in the 2019 IDE will cause it to crash during analysis within a few minutes; but compiling even via the command line will consume all the machine’s ram (and never complete).</p>
<p>The attached CS file or the code below will cause all manner of mayhem. If you remove the indicated duplicates of the 4-line clauses compilation should complete but there will still be trouble with the IDE and it will still take way too long to compile for such a tiny program.</p>

I'm using VS2019 16.1.1 (in VS2017 15.9.12 this does not happen)
The app is using .net core 2.2 and the analyzers Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.FxCopAnalyzers 2.9.2
StyleCop.Analyzers 1.1.118 

I have method with this definition:

```
public static bool HasValue&lt;T&gt;(this T? source) where T : struct
```

and in a xml doc I have this:

<pre>
/// &lt;summary&gt;
/// Internally uses &lt;see cref=&quot;TypeValidations.HasValue{T}(T?) &quot;/&gt;.
/// &lt;/summary&gt;
</pre>

In VS2019 this fires the error:

> Error	CS1580	Invalid type for parameter T? in XML comment cref attribute: 'TypeValidations.HasValue{T}(T?) '

If I change the documentation to `TypeValidations.HasValue{T}(Nullable{T})`  now I got an analyzer error (SA1125) telling me that I should use the shorthand notation for nullable types.

<p>Successive lazy linq requests can require a lot of CPU resources but it's not explicitly visible in the code. Roslyn could advise us to do a ToList() evaluation and refactor the subsequent linq requests.</p><p>We could definitely have the same kind of advice about Parallel conversion.</p>

Migrated from <a href=""http://visualstudio.uservoice.com/forums/121579/suggestions/35606437"">Visual Studio IDE UserVoice forum</a> <br><br> There are few namespace (For C#) like commonly used:
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

It would be helpful if code cleanup doesn't remove the &quot;System&quot; namespaces as they might be used eventually but it should remove other namespace if it is not used.

38382,IntelliSense lists unfitting generic extension methods,"_This issue has been moved from [a ticket on Developer Community](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/content/problem/705931/intellisense-lists-unfitting-generic-extension-met.html)._

---
Hence the following code:

```cs
using System;
using System.IO;

namespace ExampleLib
{
    public class Class1
    {
        public void Test()
        {
            object x;
            x. // use IntelliSense here
        }
    }

public static class StreamExtensions
    {
        public static T Read&lt;T&gt;(this T self out int result) where T : Stream
        {
            result = 1234; // sample code
            return self;
        }
    }
}
```

I defined an extension method using a generic type parameter for the extended class but it is limited to `Stream` instances due to the type constraint on `T`. This was done to return an extended typed instance to allow chain calling such methods.

However when typing `x.` at the marked position in `Class1::Test` IntelliSense also lists the `Stream` only extension method `Read&lt;&gt;` even though `object` is not guaranteed to be of type `Stream`. The full list shown by IntelliSense then is
- Equals
- GetHashCode
- GetType
- Read&lt;&gt;
- ToString

Is this expected behavior? Of course theoretically `x` could be passed by calling the method &quot;normally&quot; without syntactic extension method sugar. However it turns generic extension methods into IntelliSense-cluttering bad guys.

Can this behavior be made optional?
